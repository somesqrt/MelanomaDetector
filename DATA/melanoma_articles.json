      Introduction
      Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common malignancy among Caucasians.1 NMSC principally comprises basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but includes a host of rarer skin tumours.
      
      NMSC incidence is rising annually and is projected to cost the NHS £180 million by 2020.2 Although mortality rates are low, significant morbidity results as lesions commonly occur on sun-exposed sites such as the face.1 Risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer are fair skin, genetic susceptibility, living in areas of high ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, previous occurrence, age and male sex.3
      
      Epidemiology
      In 2011, over 102,000 cases of NMSC were diagnosed in the UK, 75% of which were BCCs.4 Factors accounting for the rising incidence are the ageing population and greater recreational exposure to UV radiation due to foreign travel and use of sunbeds. There is clear regional variation; the highest rates are in the South West (121.29 and 33.02 per 100,000 person-years for BCC and SCC respectively) and the lowest in London (0.24 and 14.98 per 100,000 person years for BCC and SCC respectively).1 BCC occurs most frequently and accounts for three-quarters of registered cases of NMSC.4
      
      Pathogenesis
      Exposure to UV radiation initiates approximately 90% of NMSCs.5 Both BCC and SCC result from the malignant transformation of keratinocytes and suppression of the cutaneous inflammatory response.6 Iatrogenic immunosuppression following organ transplantation results in a greater incidence of NMSC, with reversal of the BCC: SCC ratio and occurrence of more aggressive SCC. Caucasian transplant recipients have an increased risk of 65–250 times for SCC and 10–16 times for BCC.7 HIV infection also confers an approximately 2-fold greater risk of NMSC.8 Complex interplay between various factors, including dose of UV radiation, age, skin type, degree and chronicity, contribute to the pathogenesis of NMSC in immunosuppression.7 Physicians should be cognisant that immunosuppressive medications, such as ciclosporin, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, given for indications other than organ transplantation (including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatological disease, vasculitides and atopic dermatitis) will result in a predisposition to NMSC. Patients taking immunosuppressants should use sun protective measures, undertake regular self-surveillance and report suspicious lesions to their clinician for urgent evaluation.
      
      Presentation
      BCC occurs mainly on sun-exposed sites, with 80% appearing on the head and neck and 15% on the trunk.9 Lesions are slow growing and metastases are rare, but local invasion and destruction of surrounding structures can occur if lesions are untreated. There are several histological subtypes of BCC. The classical nodular subtype presents as a pink, pearly papule with overlying telangiectasia and a rolled edge and may have central ulceration (rodent ulcer).
      
      Superficial BCCs are slowly enlarging erythematous plaques, which are more frequent on the trunk and can mimic psoriasis, Bowen’s disease or discoid eczema.10 Morphoeic BCCs are more invasive and present at a late stage due to the non-specific appearance of pale, poorly demarcated plaques.10 There is a high degree of overlap among the subtypes of BCC and a mixed histological picture is most commonly encountered.11
      
      SCC may present as ulcers or indurated keratinising lesions on sun-exposed sites. SCCs may develop from pre-malignant lesions, actinic keratoses (AKs) and Bowen’s disease, which is also termed SCC in situ. AKs are a marker of UV-damaged skin and progress to invasive SCC in approximately 1–10% of cases.7 Keratoacanthomas are typically nodular, keratinising lesions, evolving over several months with spontaneous involution. They are histologically indistinct from well-differentiated SCCs and excision is therefore essential for all cases.
      
      Management
      The British Association of Dermatologists has published guidelines for the management of both BCC and SCC, which are under regular review.12,13 Historically, surgery has been the mainstay (‘gold standard’) of treatment. Other treatments can be broadly categorised as physical destruction, chemical destruction and immunomodulation. The last decade has witnessed the advent of novel systemic therapies for advanced BCC, which may herald a paradigm shift of NMSC treatment to a more medical approach.

      Surgery
      The aim of surgery is removal of the entire tumour with optimal cosmetic results. Excision of well-defined, low-risk SCCs <2-cm diameter with a 4-mm margin would be expected to remove the primary tumour in 95% of cases.13 Primary BCC is also effectively treated by excision with a 4-mm margin, giving a 5-year recurrence rate of <2%.12 Wider margins or alternative treatment methods are required for larger and poorly differentiated lesions. Mohs micrographic surgery allows for examination of the entire excision margins with staged resection, and provides excellent cure rates for high-risk BCC and SCC.12,13

      Physical destruction
      Radiotherapy has cure rates of up to 90% reported for SCC, 5-year cure rates of 91.3% for primary BCC and 90.2% for recurrent BCC.13–15 Where tissue preservation is paramount (lip, lower eyelid and inner canthus of the eye), for bony or cartilaginous sites and in patients for whom surgery is contraindicated, radiotherapy is often the treatment of choice.13 Primary BCC and recurrent BCC post-surgery can also be successfully treated, although radiotherapy is contraindicated in recurrent BCC post-radiotherapy and naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.7 Inferior cosmetic results previously made radiotherapy a less attractive option for younger patients, but techniques have improved in recent years.
      
      Some low-grade BCC and SCC can be treated with physically destructive techniques such as curettage and cautery or cryotherapy, but this does not allow for histological evaluation of margins and may give poor cosmetic outcomes.12

      Chemical destruction
      Over the last two decades, less invasive topically applied treatments have been developed that facilitate chemical destruction of tumours.
      
      Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a photosensitising agent (methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) or 5-aminolevulinic acid), activated by a light source. The photosensitiser produces photo-active porphyrins in malignant keratinocytes and illumination then results in the release of reactive oxygen species and free radical formation.16 MAL PDT is licensed for the treatment of BCC in the UK and has shown favourable clinical and cosmetic outcomes in randomised trials in comparison to cryotherapy.12 However, it is not recommended for high-risk tumours unless more effective treatment modalities are inappropriate or refused by the patient. Pain is a further limiting factor. PDT is not approved for SCC, due to the potential for metastases and recurrence, but it is effective in the management of premalignant lesions.16 A specific advantage for AK is the possibility of field treatment of subclinical, photo-damaged skin with excellent cosmetic results. Of note, PDT is less effective in organ transplant recipients on long-term immunosuppression.
      
      5-fluorouracil, which suppresses the enzyme thymidylate synthetase and prevents synthesis of DNA and RNA is also a well-established treatment for small superficial BCCs, as well as the pre-malignant lesions, AKs and Bowen's disease.7 Other chemically destructive topical agents for AKs include diclofenac gel (applied twice daily for three months) and ingenol mebutate gel (applied once daily for only two or three days). Topical agents may invoke an intense inflammatory response, with localised erythema and potential pustulation and ulceration.

      Immunomodulatory therapy
      Imiquimod, an immune modifier which acts on toll-like receptors, induces production of cytokines and chemokines from dendritic cells and monocytes.12 Topical 5% imiquimod is licensed in Europe for superficial BCC, but has not shown efficacy for nodular BCC or SCC management.12,13

      Medical management
      Systemic treatment of BCC
      Mutations of the tumour suppressor gene PTCH1 have recently been identified as underlying 90% of sporadic BCCs as well as naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome).9PTCH1 aberrations generate signalling errors of transmembrane proteins in the hedgehog pathway, causing failure to suppress signalling of the G-protein-coupled receptor smoothened (SMO).9 Manipulation of the PTCH1 and SMO pathways has formed the premise of recent developments in systemic treatment of BCC.17
      
      Oral vismodegib was the first small molecule inhibitor of SMO in the hedgehog pathway, approved for use in January 2012 for locally advanced and metastatic BCC unsuitable for conventional treatment.17 The SafeTy Events in VIsmodEgib (STEVIE) study is an ongoing international multicentre open-label study, representing the most comprehensive data series regarding safety and efficacy of vismodegib to date.18 Interim results showed response rates comparable to previous studies and progression free survival of 20.2 months for the intention to treat population (n = 496). Frequently occurring and cumulative adverse events (affecting over two-thirds of patients) may limit the tolerability of vismodegib for many patients. These include muscle cramps, taste disturbance, weight loss, fatigue and alopecia.3 Similar class effects are seen with other novel hedgehog pathway inhibitors (eg sonidegib) and the possibility of dose alteration to reduce adverse events is under investigation.18 Oral sonidegib 200 mg daily has shown a promising risk-benefit profile for advanced BCC in a recent multi-centre randomised double-blind phase-II trial.19 The antifungal agent itraconazole inhibits the hedgehog pathway via a separate mechanism and is another promising candidate drug being investigated as a systemic treatment for BCC.20

      Conclusions
      The burgeoning incidence of NMSC will continue to present a huge financial and logistical challenge to the NHS, particularly as our population ages. The advent of novel medical therapies is an exciting development, but their long-term efficacy is yet to be determined. Awareness of these common malignancies remains essential for all medical specialties. ​specialties.​​

      Introduction
      Skin cancer is a common type of cancer that emerges from the skin. It is extended due to the development of abnormal growth of cells. These cells can invade other parts of the body. More than 90% of cases occur due to the exposure of UV radiation. The UV radiation wavelength ranges from 100 nm to 400 nm. Cancer occurs due to unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells which is caused mostly due to UV radiation. In melanoma, cancer cells arise from moles on the skin which causes inflammation around the epidermal layer which in turn increases the temperature around it.1
      A survey in 2015 found about 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths occurred due to cancer. As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, considering limited health care resources. Past statistics and trends are shown in Fig. 1. In 2017, out of 5.4 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer, only 3.3 million people were treated in the US. Over 87[thin space (1/6-em)]110 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the US, but estimation found that 9730 people will die of melanoma due to lack of healthcare resources. About 2 to 4% cases of people are suffering from melanoma skin cancer in India.1 In a report published ten years ago, skin cancer ranked 10th as the most common cancer in Malaysia and accounted for 2.6% of all cancer cases in the country. Melanoma is not very prevalent in Malaysia and occurred in only 5.4% of the patients who attended the dermatology clinic in Hospital Kuala Lumpur, but awareness among them is very less.2 At present, between two and three million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132[thin space (1/6-em)]000 melanoma skin cancers happen globally every year. According to the recent research on skin cancer trends in Asia, it was found that skin cancer rates among the fairer-skinned were approximately three times higher than those who generally have darker complexions. Prevalence rates of skin cancer in Singapore increased from 1968 to 2006, especially among older Chinese.3

      Classifications of skin cancer
      Skin cancer is categorized into three types which are basal cell skin cancer, squamous skin cancer and malignant skin cancer. The first two skin cancers are grouped together as non-melanoma skin cancers. The stages of skin cancer is shown in Fig. 1.4 The features and the treatment involved in each type of cancers are discussed below.
      Basal cell skin cancer
      Basal cancer cell (BCC) is the least aggressive of non-melanoma skin cancer derived from keratinocytes that resemble epidermal basal cells.5 BCC appears like a flesh coloured pearl likes a bump or a pinkish patch of skin. BCC is due to skin exposure especially found in the sun exposed areas such as the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and abdomen. BCC can spread over the body and grows in nerves and bones. BCC is often known as non-melanoma cancer.6 BCC occurs in at least 2–3 millions of people per year. BCC has low death rate. It can be cured by simple treatment like radiation therapy and tropical medications such as fluorouracil.
      Squamous cell carcinoma
      Squamous cancer cell (SCC) is the cancer of keratinocyte cells found on the outer surface of the skin. It appears like a red firm bumps scaly patches. It is caused due to over sun exposure. It is more commonly found in people who have pale light skin. It is mainly found in the regions like ear, face, neck, chest, and back. More than 1 million of people were affected due to SCC and 80[thin space (1/6-em)]000 people died. In past three decades, there is huge increase in SCC among the US. The death rate of SCC is higher than BCC but comparatively lower than melanoma. BCC and SCC carry the ultraviolet radiation and damage the DNA directly. SCC results in ulceration and ends up with bleeding disorders. It should be treated at the earlier stage else it will grow in the dense amount in the body. SCC is characterized by proliferation of invasive squamous cells which are able to invade other tissues. It can be treated by photodynamic therapy, tropical chemotherapy, and curettage and electrodessication. SCC is the second common cancer in the world. It is not dangerous than that of melanoma.4,8
      Malignant melanoma
      Melanoma arises from melanocytes, specialized pigmented cells that are found abundantly in basal layer of epidermis.9 Malignant melanoma consist of four major histological subtypes frequently reported namely superficial spreading melanoma (70%), nodular melanoma (15%), lentigo maligna melanoma (13%), and acral lentiginous melanoma (2–3%).10 Melanoma is usually observed as a dark spot on the epidermal (outer) layer of the skin. It is the fast-growing cancer cells that have the ability to spread over the surrounding tissue of the body. The malignant melanoma is caused due to UV radiation and damages the DNA indirectly. The free radical and the reactive oxygen species are the two leading causes of DNA damage. Research indicates that intentness of sunscreen components into the skin, conjugate with 60 min exposure to UV leads to the increase of free radical in the skin.8 Globally in 2012 malignant melanoma occurred among 232[thin space (1/6-em)]000 people, and 55[thin space (1/6-em)]000 people have died.11 Malignant melanoma is the deadliest cancer, but it can be cured at early stages of cancer. It is normally treated with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy.
      Detection of skin cancer in the early stage is useful in treating the condition very quickly. Detection systems pave the way for the diagnosis, but the result was not that precise comparing to biopsy test which is an invasive method. Along with the cost involved, the after-effects of biopsy include severe infectious problem around the punctured area. If the condition found to be more severe in the biopsy test, then surgery is performed, this adds to the cost along with the complexities. Other methods like radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drug therapy can be given, but the loss of hair and sittings often makes the patient to the worst condition. By taking into account all these points, many sensors are fabricated and designed to detect the skin cancer in a non-invasive manner, unlike biopsy. In this comprehensive review article, the recent non-invasive approaches involved in skin cancer detections are summarised.
      
      Literature search performed
      The literature search was performed using Google Scholar. The search was carried out for the keywords “Skin cancer, detection techniques, diagnosis, non-invasive” for the time span of 1990–2017. From the search, relevant articles were presented, and some articles were chosen based on the pertinence. Publication trends over the years are shown in Fig. 2. This review article will be promising for researchers who plan to explore further this field.

      Fig. 4 Principles and mechanisms for skin cancer detection.	
      Principles and mechanisms involved
      Optical. When the light is passed into the tissues, the light gets scattered within the tissues of the skin. The change in the property of the reflected light is used for diagnosis.13 Advanced biochemical markers are also developed with respect to cancerous tissue and specific wavelengths are used to enhance the contrast of the tissue by absorbing light.14,15
      Photodynamic based. In order to detect the presence of tumor cells, a photosensitive marker is introduced into the particular area. Protoporphyrin IX is formed as a result of chemical reactions inside the body, which is absorbed by the healthy cells but gets accumulated in the tumour cells. When the resectoscope is introduced into the area, under blue illumination the accumulated pigment in the tumour cells emit red fluorescence and normal cells will be in blue. To provide contrast for photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) yellow-light filter is specially designed which enhances the red fluorescence. Skin lesions using photodynamic diagnosis are based on the fluorescent properties of an exogenous and endogenous compound in response to illumination. Stimulation of photosensitizers is made to produce the photodynamic effect when a certain wavelength of light is exposed to it.12,16
      Sonography. Sound waves are used in this approach. After transmitting sound pulses into the body, some of the sound waves get reflected back to the probe, while some travel on farther until they arrive another boundary and get reflected. The reflected waves are sensed by the probe and relayed to the machine. The changes in the property of sound waves are used in this technique. Sonography is used to assess skin lesion depth and margins before doing the biopsy and also used to classify adjacent lymph nodes whether it has become cancerous or not. This is added to a patient's protocol to clarify lesion depth, identify margins for excision, and determine lymph node. It has the ability to differentiate benign from malignant skin cancer. It is used to identify metastatic lymph nodes visually, which avoids unnecessary removal of lymph nodes. The main advantage is that it gives the accurate results of measuring skin cancer lesion thickness.17
      Electrical bio-impedance. The electrical impedance of skin, when measured by topical application of electrodes, is dominated by the high resistance of the stratum corneum. Changes in stratum corneum hydration or structure can be followed by electrical measurements at low frequency. Stratum corneum must be bypassed to measure the living epidermis and dermis. Direct contacts of microneedles on stratum corneum penetrate and measure the electrical activity underlying the skin.18
      Thermal imaging. Thermography is based on the phenomenon that any object of a temperature above absolute zero emits electromagnetic radiation. There is a definite relationship between the surface of a body and the intensity and spectral composition of its emitted radiation. By determining its radiation intensity, the temperature of an object can thereby be determined in a non-contact way. The human skin is a thermal interface with the human environment. Temperature distribution on the skin will be emitted in the infrared band that is useful in imaging the thermal distribution. Infrared cameras are used in clinical medicine to map the thermal distribution in the human body. Stress is applied to the imaging region so that the liquid crystal plate directly over the body make useful in capturing the image. Thermal imaging can also be performed in a non-contact manner through the infrared camera of high sensitivity. Comparing to other techniques which have false negative reports at a high probability, thermography provides high accuracy.19
      Techniques and methods
      Photography
      Total Body Photography (TBP) is also known as mole mapping which is used to identify patients with numerous nevi and changes in the lesions during regular skin examinations.20 TBP uses the digital camera for recording and storing the images as shown in Fig. 5. Using a high-resolution, professional medium-format camera, images are taken from the subjects by implementing the camera at different poses and position of the subject to get accurate results.21 Once the image is taken, it is digitally processed using mirror body mapping software. Sum of all the images is analyzed using this software. The software later generates an interactive, stand-alone program (DermaGraphix)22 containing the patient's body map. This stand-alone DermaGraphix body map, which is given to the patient using USB 2.0, tier 1 thumb drive.23 This system can also be performed at home by oneself, but the cost of equipment is high.24

      Fig. 5 (a) Illustrates the total body imaging using photographic devices and (b) shows general steps in image processing technique for skin cancer diagnosis. Reproduced under CC license form ref. 43.	
      Lynn T. Dengel, Gina R. Petroni and Craig L. Slingluff et al. had a significant finding of photography method in screening of skin cancer, but it is not used widely used due to time and cost.20 In this technique, captured the surface images of the skin to identify suspicious and pigmented lesions in high-risk patients primarily. Image processing algorithms are applied to the captured images for detecting any abnormalities in the skin. The segmentation technique which is used to detect the skin lesion is classified as region-based segmentation and neural edge detection. In region-based segmentation method, the optimal threshold is determined iteratively by an isodata algorithm. In neural network edge detection, an approximate closed elastic curve between the recognized neural network edge patterns is fitted.25
      
      Computer-aided decision tools are essential in medical imaging for diagnosis and evaluation of various diseases.26 The acquired image from the subject using high-resolution camera is pre-processed to reduce the artefacts. To overcome the artefacts like the presence of hair in the image, mean, median, Gaussian and anisotropic filters are employed. It is followed by the detection of the lesion by image segmentation technique that partition the image into disjoint areas that are homogeneous concerning a chosen property such as luminance, colour, and texture. Next process is feature extraction.27 The extraction process takes by ABCD rule that checks the symmetrical, border, colour, and the diameter of the acquired image. Once the lesion is localized, different chromatic and morphological features can be quantified and used for classification.28 In the classification part, bringing out the algorithm in the examination process combines visual processing with deep learning.29 In deep learning, the computer is trained to figure out a problem rather than having the answers programmed into it.
      
      The computer-aided technique is used to segment the melanocytes in the images taken from the skin. This segmentation is made mostly to reduce the local intensity variant. The mean-shift algorithm is adapted.30 The digital images of melanoma skin lesions can provide information about the skin cancer at an early stage without performing any skin biopsies.31 The mathematical morphology has been used for segmentation for proper identification of skin lesion area. Using TBP, different shape, texture and colour features are extracted and malignant melanomas have been classified sensitively.32 Delaunay triangulation is a technique used to extract a binary mask of the lesion region, which doesn't require any training. This is highly accurate when dealing with benign lesions, while the segmentation accuracy significantly decreases when melanoma images are processed. Geometrical and colour features were extracted from the binary masks generated by the algorithm for classification, which gives accurate results for melanoma detection.33
      
      Computer-aided diagnosis extended its framework for the detection of skin cancer in recent years. The detection of melanoma skin cancer in the early stage will be very useful to cure it and safeguard the life of the affected individuals. Authors Abdul Jaleel, Sibi Salim, R. B. Aswin et al. found that based on imaging techniques and artificial intelligence the result of computer-aided detection of skin cancer is based.34 Computer vision plays a vital role in medical image diagnosis. Reported the computer-aided diagnosis for the pigmentations of skin lesions to determine the presence of skin cancer by performing the boundary detection.35 Skin lesions can also be analysed by qualification of degree of symmetry. The other paper explains that melanoma can be diagnosed by wavelet and texture analysis.36 The texture features were derived from the wavelet decomposition and the border features were collected from the lesions borders and the selections of such features were collected by using the gain-ratio method. That was computationally efficient for the melanoma diagnosis. In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis extended its framework in mobile technologies and in cloud platforms. By this method, the system can able to classify the lesions by identifying the moles in skin images and classify them accordingly as melanoma, benign and nevus lesions.37 Computer diagnosis can also be used as a preventive tool in the detection of skin cancer via mobile phone applications. By using this technique, the melanocytes can be separated from the histopathological images.38
      
      Smartphone plays an active role in medical diagnostic of skin cancer by considering the sensitivity, specificity etc. The non-clinician users can easily differentiate the malignant and benign tumours.39 Through the computer-aided method, the patients can identify the skin cancer without going to the hospital.40 Computer-aided diagnosis can be carried out in the field of image processing, pre-processing, feature extraction, segmentation and classification of demographics images.34 Computer-aided melanoma diagnosis is used to provide the support to the physicians in enhancing the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of melanoma condition. To capture the images of skin lesions, optoelectronic probe were used.41 One of the articles reveals that computer-aided diagnosis can be used to detect the early stage of melanoma by applying the image processing technique. Images can be analysed based on ABCD technique which involves asymmetry, border, colour, diameter etc. From the skin lesion images, the above parameters were collected by considering the texture, size and shape of the image.26 These features were extracted from the images and it was further processed for image segmentation. The extracted features were used to distinguish the normal skin and the melanoma cancer lesions as shown in Fig. 5b. The other methods deal with the image processing in which the images of the affected areas are captured by using the camera of the mobile phone by moving the diffraction grating. Thus the skin cancer can be diagnosed.42 Recent updates on photography techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 1.

      Dermoscopy
      Dermoscopy is also known as dermatoscopy or epiluminescence microscopy that is useful in examining the skin lesions.50 Conventional instrumental set up for dermatoscopy includes a magnifier (×10), a non-polarised light source, a transparent plate and a liquid medium between the device and the skin so that skin reflections can be avoided. Modern dermoscope as shown in Fig. 6, do not use this liquid medium; instead, it uses polarised light that eliminates the skin reflection.51 From this method, the non-cancerous and cancerous condition can be known. Basically, this dermoscope operates under three modes, first is, non-polarised in a contact manner, second is polarised light in a contact manner then the third mode is polarised light in a non-contact manner. The main advantage of using polarized light is, it provides better visualization in deeper skin structures whereas for non-polarized the information will be only on the superficial layer of skin.52 In this system, the accuracy level is increased based on the experience of the clinician.53

      Fig. 6 (a) and (b) shows different types of dermoscopes. (a) Reproduced under CC license from ref. 71.	
      Dermoscopy shows subsurface structures of the skin with the use of handheld devices that extend optical light ray penetration beyond the skin surface and minimize surface reflection. In contrast, naked eye examination limits visualization of certain skin structures because the stratum corneum has reflective properties. Dermoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis of skin cancer. It has higher discriminating power than a clinical analysis. The report made by Marie-Lise Bafounta, Alain Beauchet, Philippe Aegerter, on the diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer shown that sensitivity and the specificity54 obtained by dermoscopy techniques were comparatively higher than clinical analysis. Skin lesion on the face was usually diagnosed by comparing the dermoscopic features of lentigo senilis and lentigo malinga55 based on logistic regression method. Dermoscopy plays a crucial role in distinguishing the melanoma cells from benign cells with the help of various diagnostic tools56 such as pattern analysis, ABCD rule, Menzies method, and 7-point checklist. The dermoscopic studies were made on 20 pigmented skin lesions57 based on the pattern analysis and the results were found to be more accurate. Dermoscopy techniques are used to analyze the vascular structure58 of melanocytic and non-melanocytic tumors based on their morphological behaviour of the skin. Dermoscopy extends its application in early diagnosis of malignant melanoma and differential59 diagnosis of pigmented lesions of the skin by in vivo methods. The study was made on 2522 skin cancer subjects60 based upon the accuracy rate, dermoscopy techniques showed better results than conventional technique, but the main drawback of this technique is that it requires a high-resolution camera to capture the images of skin lesions.
      
      Boundary detection technique which uses gradient vector flow for detecting the boundary is explained. The initialization method is automatic which makes the skin lesion border determination fully automated.61 The unsupervised approach for skin lesion images based on modified version of JSEG algorithm for detecting the border is used. The border detection error is quantified by a metric which uses manually determined borders by the dermatologist.62 An approach which is based on detecting the border using statistical region merging algorithm is reported. The border detection error is quantified by a metric which has three sets of dermatologist determined border as the base. This method is compared with four states of automated methods.63 A new method to detect and visualize the pigment network structures in the images already extracted has been reported. This detection is based on the automatic detection of the edges of pigment network structure which forms cyclic graphs. The extracted image is first pre-processed which gives the binary image; the binary image is then converted into graph and cyclic subgraphs which corresponds to the skin texture. These cyclic subgraphs are filtered to remove round structures.64 The mobile application uses the image processing technique for the prevention of melanoma. This system comprises of a microscope and a smartphone. The microscope is to image the area of skin, whereas smartphone is to get the output.65 The artefact is removed, and the borders of the lesion are detected by using border detection technique in the captured images.39
      
      Dermoscopy also employed in the diagnosis of melanoma condition in pregnant women. The study was made on 35 pregnant women66 and the results showed that the pregnancy leads to significant modifications in pigmented skin lesions. Border detection67 method was used in dermoscopy techniques to enhance the accuracy level of the diagnosis of skin cancer. Mostly for non-melanoma68 skin cancer such as SCC and BCC are diagnosed by dermoscopic methods due to its high resolution. Using dermoscopy, the irregular streaks in melanoma can be detected by performing a three-way classification of streaks which involves regular, absent and irregular in a pigmented skin lesions.69 Esteva et al., employed the deep convolutional neural network to classify melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer.70 Latest reports on dermoscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 2.

      Ultrasound
      The ultrasound signal originates from the mechanical oscillations of many crystals in a transducer, which is excited by electrical pulses, this effect is called as the piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric materials are ideal for this.72 The typical transducer consists of a disk-shaped piezoelectric element that is made vibrating by applying an electrical impulse via an electrode on each side of the disc. Likewise, the echo returning to the disk makes it vibrate, creating a small electrical potential across the same two electrodes that can be amplified and recorded.73 In modern clinical scanners, the transducer consists of hundreds of small piezoelectric elements arranged in a 1D array packed into a small enclosure.74 Thus the generated acoustic waves propagate in the fluid or surrounding tissues, from where these structures reflect the echoes which are collected back in the transducer which then transforms into electrical energy.75 This signal is then processed to get the image of the tumours in a required dimensional form. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), or optoacoustic imaging, is insensitive to photon scattering in the biological tissue and, unlike conventional optical imaging techniques, this technique makes high-resolution optical visualization.76–79
      Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an imaging method that produces high-resolution optical images in scattering media, including biological tissues. This technique is also known as functional photoacoustic tomography. MSOT illuminates tissue with light of transient energy, typically light pulses lasting 1–100 nanoseconds. The tissue absorbs the light pulses, and as a result undergoes thermo-elastic expansion, a phenomenon known as the optoacoustic or photoacoustic effect. This expansion gives rise to ultrasound waves (photo echoes) that are detected and formed into an image as shown in Fig. 7.80–82 The process is carried out with the help of computer where the image displayed on the screen is useful in diagnosing the lesions.83 The images are obtained in vertical sections are both the resolution and penetration vary according to the frequency. A retrospective study examined the usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound in the diagnosis of BCC through the identification of hyper-sonographic spots. This study concludes the conflicts between hyper-sonographic spots versus hypersonic spots in differentiating BCC and melanoma.12

      Sonography is the pre-operative studies which measures the thickness of the tumor and internal echo density.17,84 Ultrasound of B-scan technique is interfaced with the computer which uses 20 MHz frequency transducer in acquiring the image.74 40 MHz ultrasound gives higher resolution than 20 MHz.85 El Gammal et al. demonstrated the detection of melanoma using 100 MHz frequency which provided higher resolution and detailed visualization of skin layers.86 High-frequency sonography which is coupled with color Doppler gives 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in detection of melanoma.87,88 Ultrasonography is used to produce 3-dimensional imaging and detects the border of the lesions.89 White light digital photography in combination with reflex transmission imaging, which is a form of high-resolution ultrasound used to classify the pigmented lesions.90 Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is used to study the primary lesion and gives information about the non-surgical treatment. Sonoelastography is used to study the mechanical behaviour of the skin lesions.91,92 Melanoma appears as hypoechoic or as heterogeneous oval structure under ultrasound detection.93 Detailed anatomic data about the primary tumor is provided by sonography.94 Retrospective analysis is done by ultrasound for pre-surgical examinations.95 Fine-needle aspiration cytology is also used as a minimally invasive technique of ultrasound in detecting melanoma.96–98 Recent summarization of ultrasound techniques for skin cancer diagnosis is presented in Table 3.

      The laser transmits nanosecond pulses of NIR light through the transducer into the tissue. This light is then absorbed inside the tissue producing a localized temporary thermoelastic expansion. This expansion leads to the emission of ultrasound, which is detected by the transducer. Finally, a photoacoustic image is generated and displayed in real-time.
      
      Confocal microscopy
      Confocal microscopy is a non-invasive technique that allows examination of the skin with cellular resolution. It uses a focused laser beam to illuminate a specific point within the skin and measures the reflection of light from that point as shown in Fig. 8. Multiple points are scanned across an area parallel to the skin surface to construct a grayscale image.100 Different depths can also be imaged to form optical sections. A confocal microscope includes a light source, a condenser, an objective lens and a detector. A confocal microscope uses point illumination and a pinhole in an optically conjugate plane in front of the detector to avoid out-of-focus signal – the name “confocal”.101 This configuration permits the collection of light from the single in-focus plane and dismissal of light from all out-of-focus planes. The light source illuminates a small 3-D spot (voxel) within a sample, such as skin, from which mirrored light is collected to produce a pixel.102 The illuminated spot is then scanned horizontally over a 2-D grid to obtain a horizontal microscopic section. This process is known as “optical sectioning” of the image in a series of horizontal planes stacked vertically to produce an image pixel by pixel, with an axial thickness of 2–5 μm.103 This property enables a confocal microscope to look at a slice in the body of a thick semi-transparent sample, whereas, conventional microscopes visualize all the planes contemporarily.

      Confocal microscopy provides the capacity for direct, non-invasive, serial optical screening for thick, living specimens with least of sample preparation as well as a minimal improvement in lateral resolution, commonly called reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM). In vivo RCM is a non-invasive technique that allows examination of the skin with cellular resolution. Resolution is almost comparable to the conventional histology. It has the advantage of allowing the clinician to do a “virtual biopsy” of the skin and obtain diagnostic clues while minimizing unnecessary skin biopsies.104
      
      Various skin disorders of which both hyper-pigmentary and hypo-pigmentary lesions can be detected using confocal microscopy.105 Also in combination with Raman spectroscopy at various wavelength, confocal microscopy provide better cellular details.106 The recent study involves the usage of vivascope107 with the extended version which offers better imaging. From 488 to 700 nm, the laser source can be used to illuminate the tissue non-invasively to know the depth nature of tissues and its complications.108 Multispectral polarized light imaging (MSPLI) and confocal microscopy combination provide better accuracy details in results rather an individual system.109 Recent progress in confocal microscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis is presented in Table 4.

      Raman spectroscopy
      Raman spectroscopy is a technique which is used to discover various modes in a system which involves vibrational, rotational and other low–frequency modes. The detailed setup of Raman spectroscopy is as shown in Fig. 9. It depends on Raman scattering of monochromatic radiations, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared and near UV rays.116 In Raman scattering, inelastic collisions take place between the photons of an irradiating laser beam and the sample (or tissue) molecules.117 The obtained spectra can be processed and analyzed in order to provide automated feedback at the time of measurement.118 This system provides better sensitivity in differentiating the tissues.119

      One of the article deals with the classification of skin lesion using Raman spectra by a non-linear neural classifier.120 The classification model is highly probabilistic and automated. This model involves the feature extraction for Raman spectra and a fully adaptive robust feed-forward neural classifier. The component analysis of Fourier transform Raman spectra of ex vivo basal carcinoma can be diagnosed by using the Nd:Yag laser at the wavelength of 1064 nm acting as an excited source in FT Raman RFS100/s spectrometer.121 Thirty-nine set of human skin samples were collected. Among the 39 samples, 18 samples were found to be histopathologically diagnosed as non-diseased and 21 samples were found to be BCC. Raman microspectroscopy is mostly done on in vivo method. It is a non-invasive, automated and real-time application to diagnosis the non-melanoma skin cancer which includes both BCC and SCC which can calibrate the sample within less than 1 second.122 By using the confocal Raman system1 with a handheld probe, the Raman spectra of 21 suspected non-melanoma skin cancers in 19 subjects with matched normal skin spectra were collected to analyse the pathological condition. Small distinctive bands corresponding to specified Raman spectra of lipids and proteins are used to distinguish the skin lesions. Raman Spectra of various compounds can be analysed by using the partial least regression and discriminate analysis.123 Raman spectroscopy plays a major role in the study of static and dynamic properties of the biologically significant molecule in solution, living cells and cell culture etc. The contribution of various bio-compounds such as lipids and proteins in the tissue can be estimated by providing a linear least square fitting model, to analysis the skin cancer in the tissue regions.119 Raman spectroscopy can also be used as a developmental tool in medical diagnosis. By shifting the excitation energy of Raman spectroscopy from the visible to NIR regions, the fluorescence components present within the normal cells can be minimized. The software tools have been developed to interpret the spectra of the tissue to diagnose the affected areas of the tissues regions.124 Cluster analysis plays a significant role in the classification of Raman spectra of malignant tumours from normal cells.125 Latest updates on Raman spectroscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are summed in Table 5.

      Fluorescence spectroscopy
      Fluorescence spectroscopy is electromagnetic spectroscopy also known as fluorometry or spectrofluorometry that analyses the fluorescence from the sample.128 The light source used in this technique excites the electrons in the molecules, and the fluorescence is analyzed from the samples as shown in Fig. 10.129 This method has been employed in many biological, biochemical and environmental applications.130,131 Laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy is used to detect the skin cancer by in vivo methods.

      A study was conducted by E. Borisova and his team on fluorescence spectroscopy; they noticed that excitation spectrum are usually identical to the absorption spectrum, as the fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the absorption.132 The non-melanoma skin cancer can be diagnosed by the fluorescence polarization imaging technique, in which the tunable monochromatic light source along with CCD camera is employed to detect the tumour cells.133 As a result, two fluorophores were retained in tumours. Hyperspectral fluorescence is the one of the technique used to diagnosis the skin cancer in which the two ultrafast lasers were used operating at the wavelength of 355 nm that excites the auto-fluorescence between the bio-molecules that resides in the skin tissue.134 Auto-fluorescence technique is used to capture the images of the pigmented skin lesions, in which both the fluorescence and reflectance were studied.135 The excitation source used in this method is fibre coupled laser operated at the wavelength of 785 nm and the illumination of a light source is filtered by bandpass filter in order to acquire the fluorescence imaging and the reflectance imaging were obtained by the selection of components of the long pass filter. Auto-fluorescence technique is used to select the sampling points for the Raman spectroscopy, based on that the classification of various skin lesions was performed.136 Fluorescence spectroscopy is used to determine the distribution of biological substances by employing the fluorescent agent.137 The excitation source that causes fluorescence has been integrated with fiber optic probes to examine the tissue and it was recorded by using spectrograph. Fluorescence spectroscopy technique can also be used to classify the benign from malignant tumors with the help of fluorescence spectra by in vivo method. As a result, the normal tissues were found to be the wavelength of 440 nm and the non-melanoma tissues were found to be at the wavelength of 436 nm.138 Fluorescence spectroscopy has the ability to distinguish the cancerous cells from the non-cancerous cells.139 The monochromatic radiation is used as an excitation source at the wavelength of 300 nm. From the tissue two sets of fluorescence were emitted at the wavelength of 340 nm and 440 nm. The difference in intensity between the two fluorescence will decide whether the tissue is a malignant or a benign tumour.140
      
      PDD of doubtful skin lesions relies on the fluorescent properties of an exogenous drug or endogenous compound in response to a light source. Topical agents are utilized to stimulate the reproduction of endogenous photosensitizers that produce a photodynamic effect when exposed to the light of specific wavelengths and energy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the combination of absorption light and the photosensitizer.141 This technique also helps prior to surgery to detect the cancerous cells by using the photosensitizer. Fluorescence spectroscopy is performed on the tissues by using the photo sensitizer.142 Non-melanoma skin cancer can be diagnosed by fluorescence spectroscopy by both in vivo and ex vivo method. Auto-fluorescence is used to detect the presence of an abnormality in malignancy. The fluorescence intensity of dermal collagen is generally lower in tumour than in the normal tissues.143 Synchronous fluorescence method with time-resolved fluorescence technique can also be used for this applications.144 Modern reports on fluorescence spectroscopy methods for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 6.

      Tetrahertz spectroscopy
      Tetrahertz (THz) spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 11 comes under the spectroscopy technique which is used to detect and controls the properties of matter with the electromagnetic domain that are in the frequency range between a few hundred GHz to several THz. It is an imaging technique, which is used to detect the epithelial cancers. Time domain analysis is used to differentiate between diseased and healthy tissues, which are significant statistically. The location of a tumour is well correlated and increased in terahertz absorption. Diagnosis of skin cancer using frequency domain analysis in terahertz spectroscopy is by using in vitro techniques and by using tetrahertz pulsed imaging (TPI). Then data manipulation is done to determine the spectral information which is related to depth.146

      Fig. 11 Tetrahertz Spectroscopy. In this technique the properties of matters are probed with short pulses of THz radiations. In the above image (i) showing TPI handheld probe system, (A) main unit with computer monitor, handheld imaging probe and black umbilical cord (visible on the right), (B) close up of the handheld imaging probe, (C) close up of the head of the imaging probe showing the black quartz window. The probe scans an area of 15 × 2 mm, and acquires data from 26 pixels (red), reproduced under CC license from ref. 156; and (ii) showing the THz mechanism, reproduced under CC license from ref. 157.	
      The pulsed THz spectrometry is used to analyse the dielectric properties of the human skin.147 Using this technique, the contrast between the BCC and normal healthy skin was found. The THz material parameter can encounter the dysplastic and non-dysplastic nevi pigmentation and it was compared with the normal healthy skin. A skin tissue model has been developed for the THz wavelength and has been estimated for a Monte Carlo simulation of the polarized light and scattering. The studies were made based upon the Mueller matrices in order to diagnosis the skin cancer.148 In accordance with the novel optic system, it is used to capture the images of the neoplastic and the non-neoplastic colon tissue with close to the wavelength – limited spatial resolution at the spatial resolution of 584 GHz frequency were employed to study the carcinoma tissues.149 THz technology plays an important role in medical diagnosis.
      
      T waves also extends its application in both electrical and optical method to diagnose the skin cancer by means of plamonic photoconductive antenna of high sensitivity.150,151 THz spectroscopy also used to analyse the biological tissues by integrating the IR camera with IR detector.152 Using the THz imaging at the range of 1.39–1.63 THz the non-cancerous and cancerous cells can be differentiated.153 It also extended its application in the domain of biomedical which ranges from the bio-molecules includes lipids, proteins, amino acids to cells and tissues.154 It is used in sensing applications, involves detection of concealed objects, explosive detection of identifications, space exploration and THz cancer detections.155 Contemporary updates on THz spectroscopy approaches for skin cancer diagnosis are compiled in Table 7.

      Optical coherence tomography
      The backscattering of near-infrared light by tissue is measured by the technique called optical coherence tomography (OCT) shown in Fig. 12. OCT is a non-invasive method that allows 2 or 3-dimensional cross-sectional visualization of the microstructural morphology of tissues.158 It provides better depth resolved image than ultrasound imaging. OCT is an in vivo technique which works on the principle of interference (Michelson interferometry) of infrared radiation and living tissues which is the major reason for high resolution. The interferometer in an OCT scanner splits a broadband source field into a reference field and sample field. The sample field focuses through the scanning optics and the objective lens to some point below the surface of the tissue. The back scattered beam from the tissue combines with the reflected beam from the reference mirror, forming an interference pattern which is detected by the photodetector.159 Structures of normal skin, including the epidermis, dermo-epidermal junction, dermis, hair follicles, blood vessels and sweat ducts can be clearly visualized by this method. This technique allows the differentiation between the benign and malignant epithelial tissue by the qualitative and quantitative assessment of OCT images. It enables the optical biopsy of epithelial lesions.160

      A report was made by Michael R. Hee, Joseph A. Izatt, Joseph M. Jacobson, James G. Fujimoto, and Eric A. Swanson, who made a significant finding on OCT by introducing a trans-illuminance property in femtosecond laser.161 Famous authors Alexander M. Sergeev and Valentin M. Gelikonov found that longitudinal scanning of human tissue has good accuracy comparing to transverse scanning.162 Authors also used CCD camera to detect the photons but failed in showing the wider field of view.163 Cross-sectional image of human skin is obtained with higher accuracy.164 It has been proved that longer wavelength can minimize the influence of multiple scattering on image contrast and resolution; thus increase the effective penetration depth of OCT.165 Combination of both OCT and optical Doppler tomography (ODT) shows better results in scanning speed of acquiring the image.166 Even for detecting the inflammation on the skin, lesions on the skin and other infection over skin apart from tumour detection can also be performed by OCT.167 Heterogeneous property of tissue shows that collagen level in tissue can also rate the tumor growth.168 Later researchers like Aneesh Alex, Jessika Weingast and Martin Weinigel, reported that the combination of multi photon tomography (MPT) and OCT showed better resolution and high penetration depth.169 To overcome the conflicts in differentiating the non-tumour and tumour, deep margins are detected in the region of interest using the OCT.170 Increased thermal property of tissue shows various dysfunction of metabolic activity. The epidermal region shows higher thermal coefficient in the cancer patient.171 Also, the density of normal skin and tumour occurred in the skin varies.172 OCT reduces the Mohs micrographic surgery.173 Measurement of epithelial density can also be performed by OCT directly.174 Currently; precise tumour depth is performed by three methods combination namely, OCT, optoacoustic and Raman spectroscopy which shows the better results.175 Recent updates on OCT approaches for skin cancer diagnosis are compiled in Table 8.

      Multispectral imaging technique
      In multi-modal spectroscopy (MMS) or multispectral imaging, various linear polarizers of different wavelengths are used. The spectral and spatial information of the samples are simultaneously recorded by the multispectral image spectrometer, in which the acquired images from a monochrome camera is processed using spectral and polarization filtering that provides high contrasting images which is useful in identifying the pathological and morphological features of the suspicious skin lesions.177–179 Refer to Fig. 13 shows the multimodal spectroscopy setup for skin cancer diagnosis. The report was made by Hagen Nathan, Kudenov Michael on multispectral imaging based on spectral bands. In this, the image analysis is done automatically and pattern recognition is used to identify lesions which in turns help in further biopsy. It plays an important role in the diagnosis of skin cancer by considering the parameters such as texture, asymmetry, border irregularities etc.180 The images are obtained from the affected regions of the skin using the charge coupled camera along with eight narrow band filters ranging from 450 nm to 800 nm at the interval of 50 nm.181 The features are extracted from the image using the principal components analysis. The characterizations of malignant and benign tumors are separated by spatial gray level co-occurrence matrix.182

      Multispectral imaging technique includes in vivo methods in which the images were analyzed at the wavelength between 483 nm and 950 nm at equal wavelength intervals.183 Multispectral imaging employs the automated diagnosis of skin cancer using the neural network classifier. The neural network has the ability to discriminate the malignant and benign tumor with the sensitivity of 80.4%. In the multispectral imaging system, the pigmented skin lesions are separated by using the automatic segmentation algorithm.184 Usually, in multispectral imaging technique, the images of the skin lesions are analyzed as 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images at the wavelength range from visible to the infrared spectrum.185 Multispectral imaging technique facilitates the analysis of skin lesions, vascular depth and sub-cellular pigmentations.76 It uses the radiometric measurement to analysis the malignant and benign tumors.186 A multispectral imaging technique employs the multispectral camera to capture the skin lesions images. The images are analyzed based on the spectral ranges between 450 nm to 950 nm which is used to discriminate the melanoma from nevus cells.187 The self-developed software is used in multispectral imaging technique to analyze the skin chromophores which is a non-contact method.188 Multispectral imaging method finds its applications in the detection of melanoma skin cancer by considering the parameters such as melanin index and erythema index.189 It also provides the decision of undergoing biopsy from the pigmented lesion using multispectral digital skin lesion analysis (MSDSLA) device.190 Multispectral imaging technique enhances the diagnosis by analyzing the vascular depth of the skin lesion.191 The vascular depth can be interpreted with the help of 6 layered skin models. Reported the multispectral imaging techniques combined with 3-dimensional imaging sensor to detect the skin cancer.192 Contemporary reports on MMS methods for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 9.

      Thermography
      Infrared radiation is emitted by every object which possesses the temperature absolute zero point.194 The thermal imager determines the temperature of the object's surface based on the intensity of infrared radiation making it visible to the human eye with the thermal image. This process is referred as thermography. Thermal imager translates the wavelength from the infrared to the wavelength which is visible to human eye as shown in Fig. 14.195 This is the principle which is used to detect the skin cancer using thermography.196 Thermography has been employed in medicine for various applications.197 However, thermography overcomes all the shortcomings that other methods had.

      A study performed by Cila Herman198 found a significant finding on recently introduced quantitative dynamic infrared system QUAINT which measures differences in the infrared emission between healthy tissue and lesion during the thermal recovery process after removal of cooling stress. Thermistors, thermocouple and other advanced sensors are used to detect the variation in temperature.199 The rise in temperature is a significant symptom in the skin cancer patient. Nano type sensors are involved in detecting the changes in the biological analyses and the obtained information is processed to the local server in the hospital which is directed to the medical professionals in the hospital.200,201 Prateek Mathur et al. studied on temperature variation of thermal images obtained from skin cancer patient and introduced a device named sKan as shown in Fig. 15. It is a new technique which maps the affected area with the help of sensor and monitors the patient's stage in the skin cancer.202,203 This is achieved by having a template of temperature values on which the obtained value is mapped and the data are sent to the doctor for the analysis.201 Viktor Gruev et al. made a report on an imaging sensor capable of recording the optical properties of partially polarized light by monolithically integrating aluminium nanowire optical filters with a CCD imaging array. The imaging sensor consists of 1000 by 1000 imaging elements with 7.4 μm pixel pitch. The polarization imaging sensor captures intensity, angle, and degree of linear polarization in the visible spectrum.204 Current updates on thermography techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are presented in Table 10.

      Electrical bio-impedance
      The living cells membrane act as an electrochemical membrane, which is a semi-permeable membrane allows only certain entities to pass through and does not allows the certain size of entities to pass through. The leaky capacitor acts as a semi-permeable membrane. It mainly consists of electrolytes and resistive properties. Biological tissues and cell suspensions have both capacitive and resistive properties. The impedance of biological tissues is highly frequency dependent. They travel in the extracellular due to high capacitance, high-frequency currents. Study of electrical bio-impedance of tumors was done way back in 1980's by Morimoto et al.214,215
      Electrical impedance tomography (EIT)216 is being used for various biomedical applications. A report given by Beetner D. G. et al. shows the difference in electrical impedance with the frequency range of 1 KHz to 1 MHz for the lesion which has a diameter of 2–15 mm.217 The measurement was done by using electrodes of a two-point measurement.218 The measurement of electrical impedance shows the morphological changes which relate to the growth of skin cancer lesion.219 The multifrequency impedance spectra are used to detect the electrical bio-impedance for different skin lesions.220,221 The non-invasive probe separates the nevi from BCC with 96% sensitivity and 86% specificity.222 The impedance is measured by use of impedance spectrometer between 1 kHz and 1 MHz of various types of skin cancers including melanoma. This improves the signal to noise ratio. By applying small alternating voltage and comparing the measured current with voltage, the impedance between two electrodes is measured.218 The change in impedance is used to detect the skin cancer by using the information about cell shape, structure and orientation, integrity of cell membranes, relative properties of intra and extra-cellular fluids and ionic composition. This device consists of the system on chip impedance converter, AD5933, an ultra-low power MCU, MSP430F6638, and electrodes. The electrode used is Ag/AgCl electrodes, which is non-toxic and low cost.18 A smart phone based early cancer detection using EIT patch electrodes has been demonstrated.223 Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) algorithm is used in detecting the lesions which have high sensitivity in the detection of malignant melanoma.224 Electrical impedance helps in differentiating the cancerous cell from non-cancerous cell at the range of 1 KHz to 2.5 MHz.225 Bio-impedance spectroscopy also available in portable form which is used to monitor the physiological system.226 Latest progress on electrical bio-impedance approaches for skin cancer diagnosis are compiled in Table 11. Fig. 16 shows the different devices used for electrical bio-impedance measurement.

      Tape stripping
      Tape stripping is the removal stratum corneum layers as demonstrated in Fig. 17. Adhesive tape is used to remove the cell layers of the stratum cornea from the skin area. The number of corneocytes and a considerable amount of penetrated formulation will be present in the tape strips.228 Tape stripping is also known as Epidermal Genetic Information Retrieval (EGIR).90 The sample cells from the stratum corneum by the use of adhesive tape stripping from which RNA is isolated, amplified and gene expression is noted.229 This adhesive tape has the RNA genetic expression profile which is useful in differentiating melanoma from nevi.230 With the help of 17-gene genomic biomarker, the presence of melanoma is detected from the harvested specimens. This analysis is carried out using ribonuclease protection assay (RPA). This analysis is used to differentiate malignancies on the basis of gene expression profiles. DermTech's Epidermal Genetic Information Retrieval (EGIRTM) uses a custom adhesives film to collect surface skin samples. This method is painless and it can also be virtually applied to the skin surface. Also, this method has 100% sensitivity and 88% of specificity.231,232 It is a rapid and convenient method233 to contrast various changes in the cancerous patients. It also differentiate lentigo maligna melanoma from solar lentigo, which is sometimes difficult with histology.234 This method is widely used as a robust bedside system for subject with numerous dysplastic nevi.235 Can be performed from the extracted RNA only by freezing it up to −80 °C. Only then the frozen sample is treated.236 Early detection can be achieved if tape stripping toluidine blue (TSTB)237 is combined with ABCDE rule. In 2011, Wachsman and colleagues showed that EGIR performed on 202 melanocytic lesions identified 312 genes that were capable of differentiating normal skin, nevi and melanoma.229 Recent progress on tape stripping techniques for skin cancer diagnosis is compiled in Table 12.

      Multi photon scanning
      Multiphoton scanning is also known as two-photon excitation microscopy, non-linear or two-photon laser scanning microscopy which is an alternative to confocal and deconvolution microscopy that provides distinct advantages for three-dimensional imaging.239 The principle of multiphoton scanning is the nonlinear interactions between photons and matter. Interaction of two photons with the same molecule at the same time occurs in two-photon excitation. This two-photon excitation causes fluorescence. Then, the single photon is required to process the fluorescence of right energy to interact with the molecule. Excitation is not produced when the two-photon excitation is used through the specimen, as the photon density is adequately high to cause two-photon absorption. Excitation occurs in the focal spot of the microscope.240 The complete setup is shown in Fig. 18. In particular, two-photon excitation excels at imaging of living cells, especially within intact tissues such as brain slices, embryos, whole organs, and even entire animals. Two-photon excitation microscopy provides great utility for dynamic imaging of living cells in thick specimens, such as intact tissue. The technique does many possible experiments in which conventional imaging cannot be performed.241

      Fig. 18 Multiphoton scanning technique. In the above image shown setup used two-photon excitation that allows imaging of living tissue up to one millimetre in depth.	
      Researchers like Barry R. Masters, Peter T., C. Enrico Gratton, who worked on multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) demonstrated that the power entering the microscope can be controlled by Glan-Thompson polarizer which reduces power dissipation and increases the efficiency.242 In order to find the difference in accuracy for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) method and multiphoton microscopy, various histological tests were undertaken by Barry et al. and inferred that both methods have similar accuracy.243 However, resolution in terms of three-dimensional gene expressions and depths of tumor are more accurate in MPLSM.244 Later, Timothy P. Padera and colleagues found that epiluminescence property in MPLSM showed the better result in terms of gene expression.245 The major cause of skin cancer is UV rays which makes the skin to lose the collagen and elastin material in the skin are widely affected.246 Morphological altering due to skin aging is investigated by pathological characterization.247 Morphological features in 14 people who are non-melanoma are performed with MPLSM.248 Later 83 person were tested considering the morphological features of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer subjects, which showed a major difference and useful in diagnosis.249 Further to prove the accuracy of both CLSM and MPLCM in differentiating skin layer tumour, Martin Johannes Koehler and his colleagues performed pathological tests.250 MPLSM provides high-resolution fluorescence imaging, allowing visualization of cellular and subcellular structures of the epidermis and upper dermis.251,252 MPLSM based morphologic features of skin cancer images are comparable to traditional histopathology.252 Latest updates on multiphoton scanning for skin cancer diagnosis are summed in Table 13.

      Conclusion
      This article briefly summarizes the techniques which deal with the non-invasive approach towards the detection of skin cancer. The different techniques that use various modalities to diagnose the skin cancer are demonstrated with recent updates. However, every system equally shares the advantages and disadvantages in all aspects. We found that the use of TBP surveillance is must in skin lesions and dysplastic nevi which show the result but these results vary according to the experience of the doctor that lead to misinterpretation in some cases while differentiating BCC and melanoma. Also, the age of onset and frequency at which it should be performed remains unclear. This makes limited data to diagnose. Some studies show that there was no evidence in practicing photography as a screening tool in the United States by the dermatologists; instead, they prefer a dermoscopy. A handheld dermoscope is implemented in dermoscopy that provides at least 10-fold magnification of the skin lesions, and almost all primary cares adopt this mode of diagnosing. And no study reported that the survival of melanoma has increased due to dermoscopy evolution. This is mainly due to the same fact that the result varies according to the experience of physician that makes less trust in public towards the clinical screening. As far as the reviews from several abstracts, this could be changed by using a combination of both photography and dermoscopy in heterogeneous aspects that resolves all cons of the conventional techniques and provide an accurate result. The efficiency of the results is based on the usage of algorithms, devices, training and practitioner's experience.
      Nowadays to avoid false positive results dermatologist use confocal laser scanning microscopy which aid in the assessment of skin lesions by providing high resolution, high sensitivity, high specificity images that are similar to the histopathological images. The only downside of this technique is the high cost that could not be undertaken or affordable by economically backward people. Unlike other techniques, this is unique which is not engaged in comparison with other techniques (dermoscopy) trials to prove the accuracy of results. However, the reported outcomes were mainly focused on the lesion characterizations of CSLM and its test accuracy. Also, imaging modalities like high-frequency sonography, confocal microscopy and OCT have limited availability and are usually found in research units and selected dermatology departments. They are predominantly practiced on an experimental and research basis. Despite their limitations, these high-resolution techniques can give us valuable information on superficial BCC. Nevertheless, awareness of their penetration intricacies must be kept in mind because they may leave cancerous lesions that affect the lower dermis and deeper layers out of their fields of view. Many other modalities like high-frequency ultrasound sonography, PDD, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and THz spectroscopy are still in limited practice in case of skin cancer detection. Techniques like thermography which needs optimum instrumentation for the recording purpose and widely affected by the external noise though it provides a thermogram at high resolution. In case of MPLSM, bio-electrical impedance, OCT, tape stripping, multispectral imaging and fully automated computer-based analysis are considered as investigational that need clinical approval in different usage modalities. Also there are not much evidences or trials undertaken to prove the accuracy with conventional histological determination.
      
      Future directions
      The delay of implementing dermoscopy widely in the hospital and other healthcare is due to the lack of training among the physicians. This made an adverse impact in getting such product to the market field. However, usage of higher end resolution camera and instrumentation set up must provide a better result that is indirectly failed to achieve due to insufficient training. Thus proper training, knowledge and experience sharing of practitioners are must for better diagnosis. The use of computer-aided diagnosis in finding the skin lesions could be furtherly enhanced using various pre-processing techniques and segmentation method that would be more informative and satisfying the needs. It is the need for analyzing various attributes and can also be included in dermoscopic techniques so that it is easier to link with computer-aided analysis. The optical methods like OCT and PDD are still under investigation stages; this could be improved by defining the borders of suspicious lesions particularly in non-melanoma skin cancer and the common skin disorders. Further exploration is required in using the laser for detecting melanoma.
      The features of the future systems should be (i) low cost, (ii) compact and portable, (iii) less diagnosis time, (iv) comfortable (no biopsy), (v) high sensitivity and accuracy. Combination of multiple techniques should be explored for high-quality output and accuracy. Clinicians, researchers and practitioners should step forward towards arriving at a standard protocol and knowledge sharing database, thus help in providing better healthcare relating to skin cancer.

      Due to demographic change, the population is becoming increasingly older both with respect to the overall age distribution as well as to the life expectancy of the individual. To assure a good state of health even at older ages, age preventive measures such as promotion of health and early detection of diseases play an important role.
      The prevention of skin cancer is of particular significance, as its incidence has risen dramatically in recent decades.
      According to the Social Code V (SGB V), prevention denotes avoidance of diseases. It should help to prevent possible diseases or the deterioration of already existing health impairments, reduce existing risks of diseases or to detect diseases early.
      The GKV offer a multitude of early detection examinations and are obliged to inform their members of existing prevention programs once a year.
      Skin cancer is the cause of about 1% of deaths due to cancer in men and women in Germany.
      Every year about 24,000 people develop melanoma in Germany, of these about 8,000 have melanoma in situ.
      Since 1980 the age-standardized mortality in women has declined by 10%, while it has risen by 10% in men during the same time period.
      The increase of new cases of skin cancer since the 1970s is attributed to altered leisure time activity with the associated increased UV exposure.
      The primary institution involved in primary preventive information on skin cancer has been the Association of Dermatological Prevention (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Dermatologische Prävention, ADP).
      Primary preventive measures recommended by the ADP include, among others: regular use of UV protection creams, avoidance of UV exposure from 11 to 16 oíclock, staying in the shade, wearing UV-protective clothing, avoidance of tanning parlors.
      The further successful activities of the ADP including prohibition of use of tanning beds for children and adolescents in Germany, the improvement of information of adult users as well as the introduction of quality control measures by commercial operators.
      Of the mortality of melanoma in Europe 4.7% in women and 3.7% in men has been attributed to the use of tanning parlors.
      Due to limited pigment production and a very thin cornified layer, children are particularly susceptible to sun exposure.
      As of 1 July 2008 persons with statutory health insurance in Germany are entitled to statutory skin cancer screening every two years starting at age 35 years.
      Further analyses from the pilot project in Schleswig-Holstein in 2003/2004 demonstrate as a consequence of screening in the course of time a reduced mortality due to melanoma in contrast to neighboring states not participating.
      Tertiary prevention is comprised of follow-up of a prior skin cancer with the aim of an early detection of a possible reccurence.
      The duration of follow-up varies depending on entity from 3 years after the occurrence of a BCC up to 10 years or more in melanoma.
      According to several studies, self-examination after melanoma contributes to early recognition of late recurrences and subsequent tumors and was rated with a grade of recommendation B.
      In patients with immunosuppression, status after organ grafting and with multiple tumors as well as tumors with a high risk of metastasis in the first two years clinical examinations should be performed every three months.
      In basal cell carcinomas despite the low recurrence rate (30%), the likelihood of the development of new tumors (also about 30%) makes follow-up is sensible.
      Immunosuppressed patients, e.g. following organ transplantations, have a distinctly higher risk of developing epithelial cancer.
      Women tend to more frequently utilize preventive examinations such as the general health check-up. For skin cancer screening, in contrast, this applies only to the younger age.
      Dermatologists excel with regard to diagnostic accuracy, as several studies show they are significantly better than non-dermatologists with respect to the recognition of melanocytic skin tumors.
      According to SGB V Section 20 para. 1, lawmakers have fixed primary prevention in the form of a directory provision as a legal responsibility of the health insurance funds with a highly obligatory character.
      The potential for the economic benefits of prevention of skin cancer is great: On the one hand, the high prevalence leads to high costs of disease for treatment, on the other hand, the occurrence of skin cancer is to a great degree determined by human behavior and thus accessible to preventive intervention.
      In an Australian study the cost-effectiveness of a national sun protection campaign was examined and found to have a favorable cost-benefit relationship.
      In early forms, less aggressive therapy is possible, which is often less expensive and associated with less disease burden for the patient.
      Per year of survival screening measures can save costs in the range of 30,000 to 50,000 US$.
      In the final report of the pilot project in Schleswig-Holstein the savings potential of widespread introduction of skin cancer screening in Germany was calculated with over 575 million Euros yearly.

      Summary
      Prevention signifies the avoidance of diseases. It also includes the early detection of diseases and taking measures to avoid worsening of an existing disease. Prevention is divided into primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.
      
      The prevention of skin cancer is particularly important due to the rising incidence of skin cancer in recent years. In Germany, 195.000 new cases of skin cancer, including non melanoma skin cancer and melanoma are occurring. Therefore, skin cancer is among the most common cancer diseases.
      
      Primary prevention comprises the reduction of skin cancer risk behavior, including education about the danger of UV exposure and the right way of dealing with natural and artificial UV radiation. The implementation of a systematic skin cancer screening in Germany contributes to secondary prevention. First data from the initial project in Schleswig-Holstein, Germanyís most northern state, indicate for the first time that the incidence and mortality of melanoma can be reduced by secondary prevention. For tertiary prevention, the national associations recommend a risk-adapted, evidence-based follow-up for all types of skin cancer. From the perspectives of the payers and from the patients, prevention is assessed positively. Prevention can contribute to a reduction of disease burden.
      
      Introduction
      The prevention of diseases is of outstanding significance to our society. Early prevention in childhood has proved to contribute to better health in later phases of life. Due to demographic changes, the population is becoming increasingly older, both with respect to the overall age distribution as well as to the life expectancy of the individual 1. To assure a good state of health even at older ages, preventive measures such as promotion of health and early detection of diseases play an important role. Not only can the quality of life and the life expectancy of the individual be improved; in addition the social payment systems spare the avoidable costs of disease.
      
      The prevention of skin cancer is of particular significance, as its incidence has risen dramatically in recent decades 2. Here a differentiation is made between non-melanoma skin cancers, comprised of primarily basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanocytic tumors including melanoma.
      
      Definition
      According to the Social Code V (SGB V), prevention denotes avoidance of diseases. It should help to prevent possible diseases or the deterioration of already existing health impairments, reduce existing risks of diseases or to detect diseases early. Primary prevention (measures to protect the health from risks), secondary prevention (measures to detect and treat diseases at an early stage) and tertiary prevention (measures to prevent or ameliorate recurrences after disease or subsequent damage) are differentiated (Figure 1).

      Features of prevention (according to: Klotz et al. Deutsches Ärzteblatt 2006; 103(19)).
      Legal basis of prevention
      In Social Code V Sections 20 to 24b measures for prevention of diseases, promotion of health at the workplace and prevention of occupational health risks and promotion of self-help are regulated. Against this background it is sensible to utilize existing offers on prevention. The statutory health insurance funds (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherungen, GKV) offer a multitude of early detection examinations (Table 1). In addition, the health insurance funds are obliged to inform their members of existing prevention programs once a year.

      Epidemiology of skin cancer in Germany
      Skin cancer is the cause of about 1% of deaths due to cancer in men and women in Germany (about 3,000 annually), of which more than 80% are due to melanoma 2. With a total incidence of above 195,000, skin cancer represents the most common form of cancer 3. The incidence of BCC and SCC has continually risen in recent years. In Germany at present about 195,000 new cases of BCC and SCC can be expected per year. Of these about 116,000 are BCC and about 54,000 are SCC 4. The incidence of melanoma at present is about 15 per 100,000. Every year about 24,000 people develop melanoma in Germany, of these about 8,000 cases of melanoma in situ 4.
      
      While the incidence of melanoma in those over 30 years of age is just over 10 per 100,000, it climbs to about 70 per 100,000 population in those over 70 years of age. Up to the age of 55 years women, have distinctly higher morbidity rates of melanoma, with this relationship reversing in men above 55 years. Therefore -women develop melanoma on average with 60 years, earlier than men with on average 66 years 2.
      
      The mortality of melanoma in younger men and women is at about the same level. Over 50 years of age, the mortality rate is distinctly lower in women (Figure 2). In addition, the age-standardized mortality rate in women has declined by 10% since 1980, while in men during the same time period it has risen by 10%. It is suspected that the reason for this phenomenon is that women with suspicious findings consult a physician earlier and that melanoma is detected in an earlier stage 2.

      Prevention of skin cancer: evidence and current status
      Primary prevention of skin cancer
      The significance of skin cancer in the population has increased in recent decades. The increase of new cases of skin cancer since the 1970s is attributed to altered leisure time activity with the associated increased UV exposure. Therefore information of the population about the effects of UV light on the skin is of extreme importance. This primary prevention includes reduction of risky behavior with respect to skin cancer, i.e. information on the dangers of UV exposure and proper handling of natural and artificial UV radiation.
      
      The primary institution involved in primary preventive information on skin cancer has been the Association of Dermatological Prevention (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Dermatologische Prävention, ADP). Supported by the German Society of Dermatology (Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft, DDG) and the German Cancer Aid, it addresses wide population groups in annual campaigns and informs in the media and on the ADP homepage (www.adp-online.de and www.unserehaut.de) on behavior rules for prudent sun exposure. These include, among others:
      regular use of UV protection creams,
      avoidance of UV exposure from 11 to 16 o’clock,
      staying in the shade,
      wearing UV-protective clothing, avoidance of tanning parlors.
      The UV index serves as a guideline for prudent handling of the sun in children as well as adults; it is a uniform international measure which describes the daily peak value of UV radiation relevant to sunburn at ground level and expresses it as a value from 0 to 8 (Table 2). This is published daily by the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz).
      
      Table 2. UV index and recommended safety measures.
      UV index	Burden	Protective measures
      8 and higher	Very high	Advanced protective measures necessary: • Avoid staying outside of the house in the midday hours, if possible • In any case seek shade • Appropriate clothing, hat and sunglasses absolutely necessary, for uncovered skin use sun protection agent with sufficiently high sun protection factor (at least twice the UV index)
      6—7	High	Protective measures necessary:
      3—5	Moderate	• During the midday hours seek shade • Appropriate clothing, hat and sunglasses needed, for unprotected skin use sun protection agent with sufficiently high sun protection factor (at least twice the UV index)
      0—2	Low	No protective measures necessary
      The further successful activities of the ADP including prohibition of use of tanning beds for children and adolescents in Germany, the improvement of information of adult users as well as the introduction of quality control measures by commercial operators.
      
      The need to avoid tanning parlor visits is supported by scientific data on skin cancer pathogenesis and epidemiology. In a recently published meta-analysis, it was shown that the incidence of melanoma increases significantly with one visit to tanning parlors monthly for over two decades. Of the mortality of melanoma in Europe 4.7% in women and 3.7% in men has been attributed to the use of tanning parlors 5. In another paper between 43% and 76% of the melanoma risk was blamed on the use of tanning beds by those under 30 years of age 6.
      
      Conclusion of the quoted authors: Banning of tanning bed use by children and adolescents, information for adults and better control of performance quality in the tanning parlors.
      
      In early childhood particularly measures for primary prevention for UV protection are needed. Due to limited pigment production and a very thin cornified layer, children are particularly susceptible to sun exposure. Against this background the European Skin Cancer Foundation (ESCF) initiated the program “SunPass” in the year 2009. The main goal was to protect children already in kindergarten from UV radiation, to increase awareness of educators and parents and thus decrease the risk of skin cancer in the long term. For this purpose a catalog of standardized measures was created in cooperation with kindergartens and implemented. To date 55 kindergartens have already being awarded the seal “SunPass Kindergarten”.
      
      As a Europe-wide campaign under the auspices of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) the “Euro-Melanoma Week” takes place every year in the spring. This prevention campaign is implemented by dermatologists in almost all European countries and focuses on information on the risks of skin cancer, early detection and prevention in the population. In Germany Euro-Melanoma is organized by the Professional Association of German Dermatologists (Berufsverband der Deutschen Dermatologen, BVDD). Further Europe-wide activities originate from Euroskin, a cooperation of dermatologists and other scientists of several European and extra-European states. The aim of Euroskin is to utilize the international cooperation for primary and secondary prevention of skin cancer.
      
      Secondary prevention of skin cancer
      On 1 July 2008 statutory skin cancer screening was introduced as a standard benefit of the statutory health insurance funds (GKV). Persons with statutory health insurance are entitled to this one-of-a-kind preventive service every two years starting at age 35 years.
      
      The basis for the introduction of skin cancer screening as a standard benefit were the results of a state-wide early recognition program in Schleswig-Holstein in the year 2003. In this pilot project, a population-based whole-body inspection by general practitioner and dermatologists found a bringing forward of the time point of diagnosis of melanoma, BCC and SCC into prognostically more favorable stages 7.
      
      In the meantime further analyses have shown that as a consequence of screening in Schleswig-Holstein the mortality due to melanoma declined in the course of time significantly in contrast to neighboring states as well as to the nationwide comparison 8.
      
      In the research accompanying skin cancer screening, continuous surveys commissioned by the DDG and BVDD examine various perspectives of the health care system. The following findings are of particular significance:
      Perception in the population: A recently performed survey in a representative sample of the population on more than 1,000 persons questioned demonstrate that 93% consider early detection examinations as sensible and that 76% would prefer screening by a dermatologist. Nevertheless, knowledge of the entitlement to statutory screening among those entitled is comparatively low with 44%. The quota of utilization of 31% of the population can be considered high against this background. From the view of prevention better information of GKV-insured persons about their entitlement is needed 9.
      Perspective of the dermatologists providing care: Over 95% of office-based dermatologists participate in skin cancer screening at this time. The quality of care of skin cancer patients is assessed as better by over 70% since the introduction of screening 10, 11.
      From the viewpoint of the patients, screening is associated with no or only a slight burden 12. The subjective and also the objective potential for damage of screening is thus low as was formulated by the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA) in its justification of the introduction of the procedure.
      In summary, early recognition of skin cancer has attained a high status due to the statutory commission of German physicians. The evidence-based benefits of skin cancer screening were first demonstrated by the publications from the model project in Schleswig-Holstein.
      
      Tertiary prevention of skin cancer
      Tertiary prevention is comprised of follow-up of a prior skin cancer with the aim of an early detection of a possible reccurence. In the guidelines on melanoma, SCC and BCC recommendations on follow-up were formulated by the DDG in cooperation with the Working Group of Dermatologic Oncology (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Dermatologische Onkologie, ADO), the German Cancer Aid and further medical societies. Regular, risk-adapted follow-up examinations that include clinical examination as well as variable technical and laboratory diagnostics are recommended. The duration of follow-up varies from 3 years after the occurrence of a BCC up to 10 years or more in melanoma.
      
      Follow-up of melanoma: For melanoma according to the new S3-guideline 2012 risk-adapted follow-up according to the following scheme over a time period of up to 10 years is recommended (Figure 3) 13.
      
      Details are in the caption following the image
      Figure 3

      PowerPoint
      Follow-up schemes for melanoma (according to the S3-guideline on melanoma 2012).
      Of recurrences of melanoma 80% manifest within the first three years after occurrence of the primary tumor, so that intensive follow-up is recommended for this time period. In the current S3-guideline on treatment of melanoma self-examination by the patient is viewed as an essential component of follow-up. According to several studies, self-examination contributes to early recognition of late recurrences and subsequent tumors 14 and was therefore rated with a grade of recommendation B.
      
      Follow-up of SCC: For SCC the currently valid guideline (2008) likewise recommends risk-adapted follow-up that shall last up to four years in high-risk tumors 15. This includes clinical examination to register locoregional findings. A supplemental ultrasound examination is recommended if lymph nodes are difficult to palpate. In tumors with a low risk of metastasis, semi-annual follow-up is recommended until the 5th postoperative year. In patients with immunosuppression, status after organ grafting and with multiple tumors as well as tumors with a high risk of metastasis in the first two years every three months clinical examinations, if indicated with sonography of regional lymph nodes, are indicated, after this semi-annual clinical examinations up to the 3rd year.
      
      Follow-up of BCC: In basal cell carcinomas despite the low recurrence rate (30%), the likelihood of the development of new tumors (also about 30%) makes follow-up is sensible. Independent of the therapeutic approach, about 70% of recurrences after unrecognized subtotal excision usually clinically recognizable within 3 years 16, but can still occur even after more than ten years. Therefore clinical follow-up in annual intervals is recommended for up to three years. Patients with BCC known not to have been completely excised should be seen at shorter intervals.
      
      Follow-up in patients at risk for epithelial cancers: Immunosuppressed patients, e.g. after organ transplantations, have a distinctly higher risk of developing epithelial cancer 17. They should be seen in shorter intervals (every 6 months or more often) and over a longer period of time, perhaps for the rest of their life.
      
      Conclusion for all forms of skin cancer: In all the above-mentioned forms of skin cancer, a risk-adapted, if possible evidence-based, follow-up is necessary. The guidelines provide a suggestion for this. Beside physician examinations, it is recommended to instruct the patients in regular, careful self-examination that they should perform for the rest of their lives.
      
      Prevention and behavior
      Motivation and utilization of early detection examinations
      Women tend to more frequently utilize preventive examinations such as the general health check-up. For skin cancer screening, in contrast, this applies only to the younger age groups (after the age of 30/35 years), while above age 65 years men utilize skin cancer screening to a higher degree (Figure 4). Educational status also impacts the utilization of skin cancer screening. While 33% of persons with an academic background participated, only 26% of those with a junior high school diploma took part in a representative survey 9.
      
      Details are in the caption following the image

      Participation in screening programs (https://www.barmer gek.de/barmer/web/Portale/Presseportal/Subportal/Infothek/Studien-und Reports/Arztreport/Arztreport-2012/Content-Arztreport-2012.html?wcm=CenterColumn_t348846).
      In a nationwide survey in 2011 of more than 1,000 men and women, only 44% knew of their entitlement to skin cancer screening. In the same survey 45% of participants responded that the subject of skin cancer worried them 9. In order to increase the acceptance of early recognition examinations, additional prerequisites must be fulfilled such as a pain-free, low-risk examination that is at the same time performed with high diagnostic quality 18. Dermatologists excel with regard to diagnostic accuracy, as several studies show they are significantly better than non-dermatologists with respect to the recognition of melanocytic skin tumors. This also applies to the use of the dermatoscope 13.
      
      The greater experience of dermatologists in the diagnosis of melanocytic tumor is reflected in the by far higher frequency of the diagnosis “melanocytic nevus” in the statutory health insurance-authorized physicians’ care. In dermatology offices of the Regional Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians North Rhine this is coded about ten times more often than in general practitioner offices (Figure 5).

      Prevention scenarios
      One of the most important tasks to strengthen prevention is the question by what means wide sections of the population can be reached and not only those who already are health-conscious. In accordance with the coalition agreement, the -Federal Ministry of Health is currently developing a prevention strategy.
      
      Prevention measures of the GKV
      The protection from diseases and the promotion of health are inalienable responsibilities of the GKV in order to maintain the quality of life and productivity of the insured independent of gender and social status in the long term and to make healthy aging possible. According to SGB V Section 20 para. 1, lawmakers have fixed primary prevention in the form of a directory provision as a legal responsibility of the health insurance funds with a highly obligatory character.
      
      The main focus of early recognition measures remains on the early recognition of cancer. The GKV benefits catalog includes not only examinations for early -recognition of breast, colon, genital and prostate cancer but also since 2008 skin cancer screening, making Germany the first country in the world to offer this. Overall 25.3 million persons with statutory health insurance utilized the free programs for early recognition of cancer (including mammography) in 2009. Since introduction of as a standard benefit of the GKV 13 million insured persons participated in skin cancer screening, corresponding to 29% of those entitled 19. Projected on the total German population this means that 18.3 million insured persons have been screened in the last 3.5 years.
      
      Prevention at the workplace
      Promotion of health at the workplace has been enhanced in status by the GKV Competition Reinforcement Law (GKV-Wettbewerbsstärkungsgesetz, GKV-WSG). Through the new legal recognition of health promotion at the workplace, it should be insured that the measures are oriented on the needs of the workplace and that planning and implementation also take the health potentials into consideration.
      
      Prevention programs at the workplace are of special significance, as people at the workplace can be reached particularly well, as they spend much of their time there.
      
      The statutory health insurance funds are obliged to support health promotion at the workplace and invest about 40 million Euros per year in these measures. In order to inform more employers about the possibilities of health promotion at the workplace, the Federal Ministry of Health has called for all health insurance funds to submit projects for prevention at the workplace. In addition to nutritional programs and cardiovascular examinations, in several states programs on information about prudent handling of UV exposure and skin cancer screening examinations have been offered. Besides the GKV the statutory accident insurance bodies (Berufsgenossenschaften) are obliged to ensure protection from increased UV exposure in the sense of primary prevention. In Germany about 2.5 million employees work outdoors and are thus subject to an increased UV exposures. The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer is distinctly increased in outdoor workers two and a half to three times 13. Therefore occupational dermatologists also recommend in analogy to the general recommendations for the population, preventive measures for these workers such as:
      avoidance of the midday sun between 11 and 15 o’clock,
      wearing suitable clothing,
      regular application of sun protection agents.
      At present there is no occupational disease number for occupation-related skin cancer induced by UV radiation (Table 3). A recent judgment of the Social Court of Aachen, Germany, recognized actinic keratoses as precursor lesions of SCC as an occupationally induced skin cancer in a roofer (Az. S 6 (63/10) 20. With this decision, the conditions are fulfilled according to Social Code VII (SGB VII) Section 9 para. 2 to recognize skin cancer as what is termed a ”quasi occupational disease” (Figure 6). The process of setting a corresponding occupational disease number (Berufskrankheitsziffer, BK-No.) is under way at present.

      Prevention as an economic factor
      What does the prevention of skin cancer cost?
      From a health economic viewpoint, prevention can be viewed as an investment that can minimize potential costs in the future and reduce avoidable disease burden. The benefits of prevention include not only a reduction of costs also a gain in quality of life, functional ability and health.
      
      The potential for the economic benefits of prevention of skin cancer is great. On the one hand, the high prevalence leads to high costs of disease for treatment 21-23; on the other hand, the occurrence of skin cancer is to a great degree determined by human behavior and thus accessible to preventive intervention. The economic advantage can be derived not only from the avoidance of skin cancer (primary prevention) but also particularly through the earlier detection of lower-risk skin cancers, as formulated in the explanation of the Federal Joint Committee on the introduction of skin cancer screening 7.
      
      Costs of primary prevention
      Primary prevention encompasses, among others, providing information on behavior leading to a skin cancer risk. This includes in particular advice on a sensible approach to UV exposure as, for example, the use of UV protection. In an Australian study the cost-effectiveness of a national sun protection campaign was examined. The hypothesis was formulated that the avoidance of UV exposure results in a reduction of the incidence and also of the mortality. The costs of the campaign, costs of treatment of skin cancer and the achieved quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated. Compared to no intervention, the costs of the campaign were 5 million Australian Dollars (AUSD). This was opposed by the avoidance of 4,300 premature deaths with estimated costs of 1,360 AUSD per saved year of life 24. Accordingly, such campaigns have a favorable cost-benefit relationship.
      
      Costs of secondary prevention
      In many countries, secondary prevention encompasses regularly performed whole-body examinations. Early detection of tumors of lower risk is associated with a higher survival rate. In early forms, less aggressive therapy is possible, which is often less expensive and associated with less disease burden for the patient.
      
      On the basis of cost models, international studies prove the cost-effectiveness of screening programs. Per year of survival screening measures can save costs in the range of 30,000 to 50,000 US$. The calculation model is based on the costs of screening on the one hand and the prevalence of melanoma on the other. In comparison to other screening measures, skin cancer screening is accordingly similarly cost-effective 24.
      
      The decision of the G-BA to introduce skin cancer screening was also founded on the cost-benefit analysis of a nationwide measure on the basis of pilot data from project “SCREEN” in Schleswig-Holstein. In its final report the savings potential of widespread introduction of skin cancer screening in Germany was calculated at over 575 million Euros yearly 25. If the skin cancer screening introduced in -Germany in July 2008 actually leads to the expected cost savings in the health care system is being examined as part of the accompanying evaluation. Here, however, in contrast to the pilot project in Schleswig-Holstein, an adequate control is lacking.
      
      Costs of tertiary prevention
      Studies addressing if self-examination by the patient can contribute to a savings potential in prevention have demonstrated that patients with melanoma who regularly inspected themselves during follow-up had thinner recurrences and second tumors 13. These are associated with lower treatment costs and lower patient burdens, so that self-examination by the patient or his relatives can be viewed as a cost-dampening component of follow-up.
      
      Conclusions
      Prevention is legally anchored in the Social Code V Sections 20 to 24b.
      The GKV is obliged to support prevention at the workplace and invests 40 million Euros annually in these measures.
      The statutory accident insurances also have a commission for prevention to avoid skin cancer; the recognition of skin cancer as an occupational disease is in an ongoing process.
      Systematic screening measures can reduce the mortality of melanoma.
      For 93% of the German population skin cancer is an important subject, while up to now about 30% of those entitled, i.e. 18 million insured persons, have participated in statutory skin cancer screening.
      The participation rate in skin cancer screening is highest in the age group of 60–75 years in both genders.
      In the age group of 35 to 50 years women more frequently participate than men, in the age group over 65 years men more frequently than women.
      Participation in skin cancer screening from the patients’ viewpoint is seen as hardly a burden; the potential for damage is thus low.
      Primary prevention, early detection and follow-up of skin cancer are sensible from a health economic viewpoint."

      "Content": "The incidence of skin cancer is increasing by epidemic proportions. Basal cell cancer remains the most common skin neoplasm, and simple excision is generally curative. Squamous cell cancers may be preceded by actinic keratoses—premalignant lesions that are treated with cryotherapy, excision, curettage or topical 5-fluorouracil. While squamous cell carcinoma is usually easily cured with local excision, it may invade deeper structures and metastasize. Aggressive local growth and metastasis are common features of malignant melanoma, which accounts for 75 percent of all deaths associated with skin cancer. Early detection greatly improves the prognosis of patients with malignant melanoma. The differential diagnosis of pigmented lesions is challenging, although the ABCD and seven-point checklists are helpful in determining which pigmented lesions require excision. Sun exposure remains the most important risk factor for all skin neoplasms. Thus, patients should be taught basic “safe sun” measures: sun avoidance during peak ultraviolet-B hours; proper use of sunscreen and protective clothing; and avoidance of suntanning.

      One in six Americans develops skin cancer at some point. Skin cancer accounts for one third of all cancers in the United States. Most patients with skin cancer develop nonmelanoma skin cancer. This group of cancers includes basal cell carcinoma, the most common neoplasm worldwide, and squamous cell carcinoma. Fortunately, mortality associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer is unusual. However, malignant melanoma accounts for 75 percent of all deaths associated with skin cancer.
      
      Melanoma, the eighth most common malignancy in the United States, is the cancer with the most rapidly increasing incidence. One in 1,500 Americans born in 1935 were likely to develop melanoma, compared with one in 105 persons born in 1993.1 In contrast to nonmelanoma skin cancer, which typically affects older persons, the frequency of melanoma peaks between 20 and 45 years of age.
      
      Mortality rates are higher in men than in women. This higher rate may occur because lesions tend to develop in less easily observed areas, such as the back, in men. Mortality is also increased in blacks for this reason, as is the propensity to develop more aggressive tumors and to be diagnosed at later stages.2
      
      The rising incidence of skin cancer over the past several decades may be primarily attributed to increased sun exposure associated with societal and lifestyle shifts in the U.S. population and to depletion of the protective ozone layer.3
      
      Screening for Skin Cancer
      While early detection and treatment of skin cancer can improve patient outcomes,4 convincing data regarding the benefit of mass screening programs are lacking.5 In addition, the ability to identify potentially malignant lesions varies with physician training.6 Thus, except for very high-risk persons with a history of skin cancer or atypical mole syndrome, for whom periodic screening is universally recommended, there is considerable debate about who should be screened, who should perform the screening and how often screening should be performed (Table 1).7 Part of the screening process should include an assessment of patient risk (Table 2).1,8–12

      Risk factor	Nonmelanoma skin cancer	Melanoma
      Age	More common with increasing age	Peak frequency in early adulthood, but age-related incidence rises with increasing age.
      Chemicals and exposures	Use of coal-tar products, tobacco and psoralens (e.g., PUVA therapy) increase risk.	Radiation exposure increases risk.
      Family history	No influence on risk	Occurrence of melanoma in a first- or second-degree relative confers increased risk. Familial atypical mole–melanoma syndrome (FAMMS) confers even higher risk.
      Gender	Substantially more common in males	Slight male predominance
      Geographic location	Higher incidence in whites living near the equator because of greater ultraviolet (UV) light exposure per unit time	Higher incidence in whites living near the equator because of greater UV light exposure per unit time
      Medical conditions	Chronic osteomyelitis sinus tracts, burn scars, chronic skin ulcers, xeroderma pigmentosum and human papillomavirus infection all increase risk.	Xeroderma pigmentosum, immunosuppression, other malignancies and previous nonmelanoma skin cancer all increase risk.
      Nevi	No influence on risk	Nonfamilial dysplastic nevi, a large number of benign pigmented nevi, and giant pigmented congenital nevi confer increased risk. Nondysplastic nevi are markers for risk, not precursor lesions.
      Occupation	Higher incidence in outdoor workers	Higher incidence in indoor workers, as well as those with higher education and income.
      Previous history of skin cancer	36 to 52 percent chance of a new skin cancer of any kind within five years of index case	Previous melanoma is associated with increased risk.
      Race	More common in whites	More common in whites
      Skin type/ethnicity	Increased incidence in those with fair complexions; those who burn easily, tan poorly and freckle; those who have red, blonde or light brown hair; and those of Celtic ancestry	Increased incidence in those with fair complexions; those who burn easily, tan poorly and freckle; those who have red, blonde or light brown hair; and those of Celtic ancestry
      Sun exposure
      Cumulative	Single greatest risk factor; 80 percent of lifetime sun exposure is obtained before 18 years of age.	Probably does not influence risk
      Episodic	Probably does not influence risk	Intense, intermittent exposure and blistering sunburns in childhood and adolescence are associated with increased risk.
      PUVA = psoralen plus ultraviolet A.

      When screening is performed, the examiner must systematically inspect the entire skin surface. The patient should completely disrobe and remove concealing cosmetics. Daylight is the ideal light source, but full-spectrum halogen light or combined incandescent light (which accentuates red tones) and fluorescent light (which accentuates blue and yellow tones) is also satisfactory.13 Photographs may improve the quality of documentation and detection of lesion changes over time.14
      
      Identification and Treatment of Specific Skin Neoplasms
      ACTINIC KERATOSES
      Actinic keratoses, sometimes called solar keratoses, often arise on chronically sun-damaged body areas such as the face, ears, arms and hands. They may provide an indication of a person's cumulative ultraviolet light exposure and, therefore, that person's risk for all types of skin cancer. Actinic keratoses may also be associated with other exposures15 (Table 2).1,8–12
      
      Actinic keratoses are often ill-defined and irregular, ranging from 1 mm to several centimeters in size. They may be macular or papular, and generally have a scaly appearance (Figure 1). Patients often have multiple lesions. The lesions are usually pale brown or flesh-colored but may be yellow, reddish-brown or even dark brown or black following trauma. The differential diagnosis for actinic keratoses includes benign inflammatory disorders with secondary reactive keratinocytic atypia, Bowen's disease (squamous cell carcinoma in situ), discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planus and superficial basal cell carcinoma. The rate of malignant transformation of individual actinic keratoses to squamous cell carcinoma is less than one per 1,000 per year,16 but treatment of lesions is indicated to decrease the chance of progression to squamous cell carcinoma. Skin biopsy is occasionally required to rule out squamous cell carcinoma.
      
      FIGURE 1.
      
      Actinic keratoses. Note the scaly appearance of the multiple lesions. Lesions of actinic keratosis may be macular or papular.
      
      Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is the treatment of choice for most cases of actinic keratosis. Curettage may also be used and may be used in conjunction with cryosurgery or electrodessication. Surgical excision is rarely required but may be useful in excluding squamous cell carcinoma as a possible cause in lesions that are larger than 0.5 cm in diameter.15
      
      Chemical destruction of superficial lesions may be used when there are many lesions, particularly on the face and head. A pyrimidine antagonist that inhibits DNA synthesis, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is most commonly used. This agent is supplied in several topical formulations, including 1, 2 and 5 percent solutions and 1 and 5 percent creams. Areas other than the head and neck require the higher concentrations because of greater skin thickness. In conventional regimens, 5-FU is applied twice daily for two to five weeks. Adverse effects include true hypersensitivity, secondary bacterial and herpetic infection, and postinflammatory pigmentation changes. This therapy is often associated with significant discomfort related to an intense inflammatory response. Pulsed dosing regimens aimed at reducing skin irritation have met with mixed success.17 Topical corticosteroids may reduce inflammation but also make the treatment end point difficult to discern.18 Other therapies used occasionally for treatment of actinic keratoses include carbon dioxide laser, topical tretinoin, chemexfoliation (chemical peeling) and facial dermabrasion.
      
      SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
      Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer, comprising 20 percent of all cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer. This is the most common tumor in elderly patients, and it is usually the result of a high lifetime cumulative dose of solar radiation. However, other irritants and exposures may lead to squamous cell carcinoma (Table 2).1,8–12 Up to 60 percent of squamous cell carcinomas occur at the site of a previous actinic keratosis.19 Changes in an actinic keratosis that suggest evolution to squamous cell carcinoma include pain, erythema, ulceration, induration, hyperkeratosis and increasing size.
      
      As many as 50 to 60 percent of squamous cell carcinomas occur on the head and neck (Figure 2). Other common sites include the hands and forearms, upper trunk and lower legs. Squamous cell carcinomas typically appear as exophytic tumors that may grow moderately rapidly over a period of months and range from a few millimeters to centimeters in size. They may appear nodular or papular, and may be reddish-brown, pink or flesh-colored. Larger squamous cell carcinomas may appear crusted, erythematous or eroded. In contrast to basal cell carcinoma, a definitive edge is difficult to demonstrate when a squamous cell carcinoma lesion is stretched.16
      
      FIGURE 2.
      
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the face.
      
      The differential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma includes actinic keratosis, amelanotic melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, benign tumors, keratoacanthoma, healing traumatic wounds, spindle cell tumor and warts. Histologic confirmation by a full-thickness skin biopsy (incisional or excisional) is mandatory before definitive treatment. Well-differentiated lesions less than 2 cm in diameter can be treated with surgical excision, with a cure rate approaching 99 percent. Typically, an elliptical excision with margins of 4 to 6 mm is employed.19
      
      Squamous cell carcinomas may grow aggressively and are associated with a 2 to 6 percent risk of metastasis. Risk factors for metastasis include poor cell differentiation, increasing lesion depth and location on the lip or ear. The most common locations for metastatic spread are the regional lymph nodes, lungs and liver. Once metastasis occurs, the five-year cure rate for squamous cell carcinoma is 34 percent. Recurrence and metastasis typically occur within three years of initial treatment.
      
      Mohs' micrographic surgery involves gradual lesion excision using serial frozen section analysis and precise mapping of excised tissue until a tumor-free plane is reached. Mohs' micrographic surgery is used when tissue removal must be kept to a minimum for cosmetic reasons or to maximize function. It is the treatment of choice for difficult and high-risk squamous cell carcinomas, including lesions that are larger than 2 cm in diameter; located in areas where deep invasion is more likely or tumor extent is hard to assess, such as the nasolabial folds, eyelids and periauricular areas (facial “H zone”); rapidly growing; recurrent or incompletely excised; ill-defined; located in an area of previous irradiation; or located where perineural invasion is likely. Cure rates of 99 percent have been reported.20
      
      Cryotherapy and the combination of curettage and desiccation are reserved for treatment of superficial tumors, lesions less than 2 cm in diameter and lesions located on the trunk and extremities. Radiation therapy may be employed when preservation of function and cosmesis are critical, when patients refuse surgery, when metastasis is present or when an adjunct to surgery is required for high-risk tumors. Because of the long-term risk of radiation-induced carcinoma, radiation therapy is used only in patients older than 60 years.16
      
      BASAL CELL CARCINOMA
      Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin neoplasm. Basal cell carcinomas may be classified as one of six types: nodular, the most common type (Figure 3a); pigmented (Figure 3b); cystic; sclerosing or morpheaform (Figure 3c); superficial (Figure 3d); and nevoid. The sclerosing type may extend beyond clinically assessed borders and is the most difficult type to adequately treat. Basal cell carcinomas are usually located on the face or the backs of the hands. They typically grow slowly and generally spread only locally. Metastasis is quite rare.
      
      FIGURE 3.
  
      Common types of basal cell carcinoma. (A) Nodular; (B) pigmented; (C) sclerosing; (D) superficial. Note the characteristic rolled borders and telangiectasias.
      
      While a preliminary diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma may be made on the basis of appearance, incisional or excisional biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Cure rates of 95 to 99 percent can be achieved for low-risk lesions using simple excision with margins of 2 to 5 mm.21,22 A lesion is considered low risk if it is less than 1.5 cm in diameter; has not previously been treated; is not in a difficult-to-treat area, like the H zone of the face; and is nodular or cystic.21
      
      Treatment of basal cell carcinomas with cryotherapy can also be successful, but healing may take weeks, and success depends on the skill of the cryotherapist. Curettage with electrodesiccation or freezing may also be used for tumors less than 1.5 cm in diameter. These modalities are associated with lower cure rates when used to treat sclerosing and recurrent tumors.22 Mohs' micrographic surgery is the treatment of choice for most sclerosing basal cell carcinomas, as well as for large tumors and those located in areas that are difficult to treat. Radiation therapy produces cure rates of 90 to 95 percent but has the same limitations as those outlined for squamous cell carcinoma treatment.22 Other therapies used occasionally include oral retinoids; topical tretinoin; carbon dioxide and neodynium-YAG lasers; topical 5-FU; and, for inoperable and metastatic tumors, chemotherapy.21–23
      
      MALIGNANT MELANOMA
      There are four types of malignant melanoma.18 The superficial spreading type is the most common among whites and accounts for 70 percent of all melanomas. It usually occurs in adults and may develop anywhere on the body but appears with increased frequency on the upper backs of both men and women and on the legs of women (Figure 4).
      
      FIGURE 4.
      
      Superficial spreading malignant melanoma.
      
      Nodular melanoma (accounting for 15 to 30 percent of all melanomas) is a dome-shaped, pedunculated or nodular lesion that may occur anywhere on the body. It is commonly dark brown or reddish brown but may occasionally be amelanotic. Nodular melanomas tend to rapidly invade the dermis from the onset with no apparent horizontal growth phase. These tumors are frequently misdiagnosed, because they may resemble blood blisters, hemangiomas, dermal nevi or polyps (Figure 5).
      
      FIGURE 5.
      
      Nodular malignant melanoma.
      
      Lentigo maligna melanoma (which accounts for 4 to 10 percent of all melanomas) originates from lentigo maligna. Untreated lentigo maligna tends to exhibit horizontal or radial growth with epidermal involvement for many years (often decades) before it enters the vertical growth phase and invades the dermis to become lentigo maligna melanoma. This change is often indicated clinically by the development of focal papular or nodular areas (Figure 6).
      
      FIGURE 6.
      
      Lentigo maligna melanoma.
      
      Acral lentiginous melanoma (2 to 8 percent of all melanomas) occurs on the palmar and plantar surfaces, the digits and the subungual areas (Figure 7). Unlike other subtypes of melanoma, it has a similar incidence in all ethnic groups.
      
      FIGURE 7.

      Acral lentiginous melanoma.
      
      Melanomas that do not fit easily into any of these subtypes are simply labeled malignant melanoma.
      
      Evaluation of Pigmented Lesions
      Common benign lesions that mimic melanoma include seborrheic keratoses, benign acquired nevi and solar lentigenes. Other lesions that mimic melanoma are more ominous. Large congenital nevi (greater than 20 cm in diameter) are clearly associated with an increased risk of melanoma,24 and controversy exists regarding the potential for malignant transformation in smaller congenital nevi. Lentigo maligna (Hutchinson's melanotic freckle), discussed above, is commonly located in sun-damaged areas on the heads and necks of elderly persons. Because lentigo maligna is considered by many authorities to be a melanoma in situ, prompt excision is generally indicated.
      
      Atypical or dysplastic nevi may lead to melanoma. These macular to papular lesions may be present in great numbers in affected patients and up to 6 mm or larger in size. They have a cobblestone surface with a variable mixture of tan, brown, and red or pink coloration, and characteristically ill-defined borders (Figure 8). Dysplastic nevi with substantial asymmetry, excessive pigmentary variegation and focal black or gray areas suggestive of partial regression should be biopsied. In the atypical mole syndrome, an autosomal dominant familial disorder, affected persons have numerous dysplastic nevi and often develop melanoma at a young age. Patients with atypical mole syndrome require periodic screening and preventive education.25
      
      FIGURE 8.

      
      Dysplastic nevi.
      
      Clinical application of the ABCD checklist may improve detection of suspicious lesions26 (Table 3). Although melanomas may lack one or more of these features, their presence, especially in combination, should raise suspicion of malignancy. The ABCD checklist has been reported to have a sensitivity of 92 to 100 percent and a specificity of 98 percent for the detection of melanoma.11 It may also be prudent to lower the threshold for biopsy when a patient is worried that a nevus may be cancerous or reports recent changes in the nevus such as increased size, alteration of shape or color, itching, burning, bleeding or pain. The revised seven-point checklist, which incorporates these findings, has a reported sensitivity of 79 to 100 percent (Table 4).6 Its low specificity of 30 to 37 percent reflects the fact that most melanomas are asymptomatic.6 Dermoscopic evaluation of suspicious lesions may also help clarify the need for biopsy. In dermoscopy, a hand-held microscope with a 10-power lens is pressed on the skin lesion after the application of oil. The presence or absence of subsurface features suggestive of melanoma guides the need for biopsy.27

      Diagnosis, Staging and Therapy
      Biopsies for evaluation of suspected melanoma should generally be excisional. An elliptical excision that includes 1 to 2 mm of normal skin surrounding the lesion and extends to the subcutaneous tissue provides acceptable histopathologic margins. A larger margin is unnecessary and may entail an excessively wide definitive excision if melanoma is confirmed. Incisional and punch biopsies of the most visually concerning lesion segments, considered acceptable by some, may be problematic because the histologic diagnosis of melanoma depends on overall lesion architecture and because such areas may not contain the most histopathologically diagnostic tissue.28 Therefore, complete excision should be strongly considered even when the lesion is large or located in a cosmetically sensitive area.
      
      Prognosis in patients with clinically localized disease is directly related to tumor thickness (Table 5).18,29 The prognosis is more favorable in women, in persons less than 50 years of age and for tumors that occur on an extremity (excluding the hands and feet). The five-year survival rate in patients with nodal spread is about 36 percent and drops to 5 percent in those with distant metastasis.6 Patients with melanoma proved by biopsy should be expeditiously referred to a dermatologist for treatment.

      Prevention of Skin Cancer
      Primary prevention of skin cancer is based on increasing public awareness of the risks of sun exposure and providing patients with individualized guidance. Patients who are educated about risk factors for skin cancer are more likely to self-select for clinical screening30 and to bring malignant lesions to the attention of a health care provider.31 Family physicians can easily integrate education regarding “safe sun” guidelines into general preventive counseling (Table 6).1 While the role of sunscreens has been questioned, most evidence suggests that their correct use can lower the risk of skin cancer.32 Sufficient amounts must be applied at least 30 minutes before sun exposure, with reapplication after prolonged exposure or swimming. Most importantly, sunscreens will not be effective unless they are employed as only one element of a skin cancer prevention program.
      
      TABLE 6
      
      “Safe Sun” Guidelines for Prevention of Skin Cancer
      Sun exposure during the peak ultraviolet-B (UV-B) hours should be avoided or minimized. The peak UV-B period is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
      Sunscreen with a solar protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 should be generously applied.
      In addition to use of an appropriate sunscreen, persons should wear wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses and protective clothing (e.g., tightly woven fabrics and long-sleeved shirts) when sun exposure during peak UV-B hours cannot be avoided.
      Deliberate sun tanning and use of tanning parlors should be avoided.

      Malignant melanoma continues to present a significant public health problem as its incidence is rising faster than that of any other cancer in the US. At current rates, 1 in 74 Americans will develop melanoma during his or her lifetime.
      
      Management of melanoma is a complex issue requiring a multidisciplinary approach. The most effective method of protection against the development of melanoma is minimization of ultraviolet exposure from sunlight. Early detection and treatment are critical and result in improved patient survival rates. Surgical excision remains the mainstay of treatment but many new promising therapies are being investigated.
      
      It is hoped that increased public and professional awareness and education in all areas relating to the prevention, detection, and treatment of malignant melanoma will contribute to decreasing trends in the incidence and mortality from this cancer in the future.
      
      Introduction
      Malignant melanoma represents a significant and growing public health burden in the US and worldwide.1 This year, it is estimated that 47,700 cases of invasive malignant melanoma and 20,000 to 40,000 cases of melanoma in-situ will be newly diagnosed in the US.
      
      Melanoma is also one of the few remaining cancers with an increasing incidence rate.2 In the 1930s, the lifetime risk of an American developing invasive malignant melanoma was 1 in 1,500. Currently, that risk is 1 in 74 (Fig. 1). Deaths from malignant melanoma are also increasing:1 The mortality rate from malignant melanoma has risen about 2% annually since 1960 (Fig. 2). This year, it is estimated that 7,700 persons will die from malignant melanoma in the US.
      
      Survival of patients with malignant melanoma is directly related to early detection. Melanoma that is confined to the epidermis (in-situ) carries no risk of death and a thin melanoma lesion carries very little risk of metastatic spread.3 Although multiple factors influence survival, thickness of the tumor has been shown to be the most important factor across multiple studies.4 The five-year survival rate for patients with early melanoma, defined as thinner than 1 mm, is 94% versus less than 50% for those with melanomas greater than 3 mm in thickness (Fig. 3).3
      
      Fortunately, despite rising incidence, there has been a marked concomitant increase in the five-year survival rate, from approximately 40% in the 1940s to almost 90% now.5 As the effectiveness of the principal treatment modality for primary malignant melanoma (i.e., surgical excision) has not changed substantially over the past several decades, the improved five-year survival rate can be attributed to earlier detection. Despite improved survival rates, the death rate from malignant melanoma continues to climb as a result of exponential increases in incidence.6

      Lifetime Risk of Developing Invasive Melanoma (US)
      
      Malignant melanoma is a potentially lethal melanocytic neoplasm with a propensity for distant metastasis. Lesions may arise de novo, or within dysplastic, congenital, or banal nevi.7-10 Early detection and definitive therapy are necessary to minimize the risk of metastatic disease.
      
      Melanoma may be virtually preventable with simple behavioral changes. Even with new strategies being developed to treat advanced disease, therefore, emphasis on prevention in professional and public education, as well as on early detection and treatment of this tumor is becoming increasingly important in this new century.
      
      Prevention of Melanoma
      IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH RISK
      The identification of individuals at high risk for malignant melanoma is important for the development of focused and efficient prevention efforts. Acute sun exposure resulting in sunburn remains a significant risk factor for the development of melanoma,11 but numerous other potential risk factors have been cited.12 Included among these are atypical mole syndrome/dysplastic nevus syndrome (Fig. 4), 10, 13-15 blistering sunburns,16 immunosuppression,17, 18 prior therapy with psoralen with ultraviolet (UV) A light,19, 20 UV exposure at tanning salons,21 elevated socioeconomic status,22 and history of melanoma in a first-degree relative.23-26
      
      Certain phenotypic factors—including blue/green eyes, blond or red hair, light complexion, freckles, sun sensitivity, and an inability to tan27—have been consistently associated with increased risk for the development of malignant melanoma. Other significant risk factors include a family history of melanoma,28 a personal history of nonmelanoma skin cancer or precancer, increased numbers of melanocytic nevi,27 increased numbers of melanocytic nevi in childhood, and xeroderma pigmentosum.29 Nevertheless, malignant melanoma can develop in any individual. The incidence of plantar surface melanoma in blacks is the same as in Caucasians.30

      Common presentations of the dysplastic nevus (atypical mole).
      
      Using multivariate analysis, it was determined that the following six risk factors independently influenced the risk of developing malignant melanoma:31
      Family history of malignant melanoma
      
      Presence of blond or red hair
      
      Presence of marked freckling on the upper back
      
      History of three or more blistering sunburns prior to age 20
      
      History of three or more years of an outdoor summer job as a teenager
      
      Presence of actinic keratosis
      
      Persons with one or two of these risk factors had a 3.5-fold increased risk for developing malignant melanoma compared with the general population. Those having three or more of the factors had an approximately 20-fold increased risk.
      
      Environmental factors that increase the risk for malignant melanoma include living near the equator, working outdoors, and having primarily outdoor recreational habits.32, 33
      
      Furthermore, people who have had one malignant melanoma are at an increased risk of developing another.34 Their risk ranges from 4% to 30%35, 36 compared with the approximately 1% lifetime risk of malignant melanoma in all Americans.
      
      Previous studies have demonstrated an association between germline mutations in tumor suppressor p16 and development of melanoma in melanoma kin-dreds,23, 37-41 and recent studies have noted somatic p16 mutations in sporadic melanoma, as well.14 Potentially, a better understanding of these mutations and characterization of other molecular risk factors may enable us to identify highest risk individuals at the molecular level for more effective targeting of prevention and early detection efforts.
      
      Prevention and Photoprotection
      Since virtually all of the known risks for melanoma are related to susceptibility to, and the magnitude of, UV radiation exposure, protection from the sun's rays plays a critical role in prevention. The most appropriate endpoint for determining the effectiveness of public policies regarding sun protection is the melanoma incidence rate.
      
      Almost $500 million is spent on sunscreen annually in the Us,42 and recent retrospective studies have shown the protective effect of sunscreens on malignant melanoma.33, 43 In Australia, where 74% of the population regularly uses sunscreen,44 melanoma incidence and mortality rates are beginning to fall. As sunscreen is the most commonly used method of sun protection in Australia, it is clear that these products have played a major role in this turnabout.
      
      Melanoma rates are also falling among Hawaiian Caucasians, a group that has among the highest per capita use of sunscreen in the US.45 Until we have prospective data to show the effect of sunscreens on melanoma risk more directly, these findings represent some of the best evidence of the protective effect of sunscreen use on melanoma incidence in large populations of individuals.
      
      The conclusion that currently can best be drawn from all existing data is that a combination regimen of sun protection that includes protective clothing, avoiding midday sun, and regular use of broad-spectrum high sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreen (such as practiced in Australia), may be beginning to reduce melanoma incidence rates in some populations.46 This is the current recommendation of the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Cancer Society.

      Enhancing Early Diagnosis
      CLINICAL FEATURES
      The goal of effective clinical recognition of early melanoma remains foremost for the successful management of this cancer. Early melanoma can be recognized using the following ABCD guideline (Fig. 5):47
      Asymmetry—Most early lesions grow at an uneven rate resulting in an asymmetric pattern.
      
      Border Irregularity—The uneven growth rate also results in an irregular border.
      
      Color Variegation—Irregular growth also causes new shades of black, and light and dark brown.
      
      Diameter—Lesions with ABC features and diameters of greater than 6 mm should be considered suspicious for melanoma.
      
      Advanced melanomas are more readily apparent and may be typically nodular or ulcerated (Fig. 6).
      
      In addition to the classic appearing melanoma, a non-pigmented variant, amelanotic malignant melanoma, may mimic a pyogenic granuloma or a basal cell carcinoma clinically (Fig. 7).25, 48-50 Also, melanoma may simulate benign lesions, including seborrheic kera-toses, melanocytic nevi, lentigines, and ephilides (Fig. 8).
      
      The evolving health care environment has placed an increasing emphasis on the diagnosis of melanoma by primary care physicians. Yet a recent study showed that non-dermatologists may be three times as likely to misdiagnose melanoma compared with dermatologists.27 it is especially important, therefore, for primary care providers to raise their index of suspicion regarding pigmented lesions and to sharpen their diagnostic skills with respect to melanoma.
      
      HISTOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS
      Melanoma is histologically characterized by proliferation of atypical melanocytes with single cells predominating.51 Also characteristic is the presence of mitotic figures. Special stains, such as S100, HMB45, and most recently Mel45 in lentigo malignant melanoma, may be useful in the histologic diagnosis of melanoma. These stains are particularly useful in distinguishing the spindle cell variant of melanoma from other spindle cell neoplasms, including the spindle cell variant of squamous cell carcinoma and atypical fibroxanthoma, as well as in the diagnosis of melanomas initially presenting as metastatic malignancy of unknown primary site. In the future, these and other special stains may be useful in determining tumor-free margins on frozen section, thus allowing utilization of tissue conservation in melanoma surgery.52-56

      Diagnosis
      Diagnosis of melanoma depends on clinical identification with histopathologic confirmation. To rule out melanoma in a clinically suspicious lesion, adequate biopsy must be performed and the specimen should be evaluated by a dermatopathologist or a pathologist experienced in the evaluation of pigmented lesions. In some patients, particularly those with atypical mole syndrome, biopsy of each suspicious lesion may be impossible. Full body or lesional photography may assist in the identification of recently changed lesions in these patients.
      
      Recently, epiluminescence microscopy has been used in the evaluation of pigmented lesions.50, 57-59 With this technique, pigmented lesions are examined in-situ, under immersion oil, using a dermatoscope (a specially designed 10x lens mounted in an ophthalmoscope-like configuration). Use of dermatoscopy has led to the definition of a new set of subsurface features that may be helpful for in vivo diagnosis and holds exciting potential for improved diagnosis in the future (Fig. 9).
      
      Another area of active research involves computer-assisted analysis of digitized dermatoscopic images.60-62 In the future, digitized clinical and dermatoscopic images compared with a sizable database might offer increased sensitivity and/or specificity in the diagnosis of potentially malignant pigmented lesions. Telemedicine may also play an increasing role. Nevertheless, the bottomline in the diagnosis of melanoma is likely to continue to depend on the clinical acumen of the clinician and the histologic expertise of the pathologist.

      Maximizing Early Detection: Routine Examination of the Skin
      As Neville Davis said, unlike other cancers, which are generally hidden from view, “Malignant melanoma writes its message in the skin with its own ink and it is there for all of us to see. Some see but do not comprehend.”47 As survival rates of patients with thinner malignant melanomas are much higher than those for patients with thicker ones, it is incumbent upon health care professionals to “comprehend” and “act” as early as possible.
      
      The goal is to recognize early (thin) malignant melanomas when they are flat and curable.
      
      Early detection of breast cancer is facilitated by both regular clinical and frequent self-examinations.63 similarly, if malignant melanomas are to be identified while they are still curable, complete cutaneous examinations by physicians and other health care providers should be made, coupled with periodic self-examination of the skin by the individual.
      
      Clinical Examination of the Skin
      The equipment needed for complete examination of the skin is simple: An examination table, a source of bright light, and, occasionally, a magnifying lens. To facilitate examination of the scalp, an ordinary inexpensive blow dryer can be used.
      
      The entire cutaneous surface should be examined. All pigmented lesions should be examined and carefully evaluated. Since a skin biopsy is usually such a simple procedure, any lesion even remotely suggestive of malignant melanoma should be given special attention and considered for histologic evaluation.
      
      Self-Examination of the Skin
      By routine self-examination of the skin, the patient assumes some of the responsibility for identifying early malignant melanoma at a time when such lesions are thin and curable.64
      
      A thorough self-examination of the skin requires the individual to undress completely and to have a full-length mirror, a hand-held blow dryer, two chairs, and a well-lit room.
      
      During the first self-examination, the patient should spend a good deal of time carefully inspecting the entire surface of the skin. With experience, self-examination should take but a few minutes. To look at parts of the skin surface that may be hard to see—e.g., some areas of the back, scalp, and buttocks—the patient may find it helpful to enlist the help of a spouse, relative, or friend.
      
      Self-examination of the skin should be carried out step-by-step as shown in Figure 10. These pages can be photocopied and given to patients to encourage learning and practice of this important technique. Educational pamphlets for the public are also available through the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Dermatology, and the skin Cancer Foundation.
      
      The patient should see a physician if he or she discovers a new pigmented lesion or any significant change in a preexisting pigmented lesion. Most early malignant melanomas are macular and grow in diameter for some time before they become elevated. Macular lesions are almost always curable, whereas lesions that develop plaques, papules, or nodules have a greater risk for metastases. The goal is to recognize early (thin) malignant melanomas when they are flat and curable.

      Self-Examination of The Skin
      
      Maximizing Early Detection: Screening
      Since 1985, the American Academy of Dermatology has sponsored free annual National Melanoma/Skin Cancer Prevention Campaigns.65 By this year, over 1,000,000 persons have been screened and thousands of melanomas have been detected, most in their earliest stages.66 Local divisions of the American Cancer Society have also greatly aided in these programs, along with many volunteer dermatologists and other interested health care professionals.
      
      Clearly, if every American were completely examined yearly for malignant melanoma, death from this disease would be a rare event. The cost-benefit ratio of skin-cancer screening, as well as the feasibility of screening 280 million Americans for skin cancer, however, need to be resolved.67
      
      Perhaps a more realistic goal is to target screening for melanoma to those at highest risk. Indeed, in a 1987 screening in Massachusetts, 86% of the people screened had at least one risk factor for malignant melanoma and 78% had at least two.68
      
      Enhancing Treatment Effectiveness
      Melanoma is a tumor with aggressive metastatic potential,39 particularly to lymph nodes, lung, and brain. Reports of metastases to other organs including bone, pancreas, adrenals, and small intestine have been described.
      
      Treatment options and follow-up intervals for patients with melanoma vary with the depth of the primary lesion and stage. The primary therapeutic approach for melanoma is surgical excision, which is almost 100% effective when treating an early tumor. Chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy, including the use of biologic response modifiers and vaccines, provide supplemental treatment for more advanced tumors. Combination regimens are often used, depending on tumor stage (Table 1a and b)69-73
      
      SURGERY
      Surgical excision is the mainstay of therapy for malignant melanoma.74 Recent studies support more conservative margins than were suggested previously. A margin of 0.5 cm is currently suggested for in-situ melanoma, whereas a margin of 1 cm is considered adequate for lesions less than 1 mm deep. For lesions between 1 and 2 mm in depth, a 2-cm margin is suggested, while most studies support margins of 2 to 3 cm for lesions greater than 2 mm in depth. Depth of excision should be to the level of fascia, as no added benefit has been shown for excisions of greater depth.
      
      Wide and deep excision of malignant melanoma may be difficult to impossible to perform, depending on anatomic site. Thus, some dermatologic surgeons are attempting to perform tissue-conserving procedures, particularly for melanomas occurring on the face. The role of Mohs micrographic surgery in the treatment of lentigo malignant melanoma is the subject of ongoing debate. Proponents cite the added benefit of histologic margin control and tissue conservation in this highly recurrent tumor.56, 75 Others cite the difficulties inherent in distinguishing atypical melanocytes in frozen sections. Increased sensitivity may be gained through the use of special stains. Zitelli et al report a success rate of 99.5% at five years in the treatment of malignant melanoma with the Mohs technique.76
      
      Lymph Node Biopsy
      Elective Lymph Node Dissection: The appropriate role of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) for patients with clinical stage I, intermediate thickness melanoma has been the subject of debate and has been reviewed extensively.77-79, 8, 3 Patients most likely to benefit from ELND are those with a high probability of harboring occult nodal disease and low probability of distant spread. Patients with intermediate thickness melanomas (1.0 to 4.0 mm) may have occult disease in 40% of cases but distant spread in only 10% of cases. In contrast, patients with lesions greater than 4 mm in thickness not only have a higher likelihood of occult disease (60%), but also an increased likelihood of distant spread (70%) and thus would be less likely to benefit from lymph node dissection.
      
      Table Table 1a. Management of melanoma Patients
      image
      Table Table 1b. Follow-up Schedule for Melanoma Patients Months Between Visits
      image
      The question regarding potential benefit of lymph node dissection in malignant melanoma has been evaluated in several studies. Results of the WHO trial No. 1 study suggested that ELND confers no significant benefit in malignant melanoma,83 although no subgroup analysis was performed. The WHO trial No. 14 demonstrated improved survival in patients with nodal metastases.
      
      The MAYO Clinic Surgical Trial, which included patients with malignant melanoma of all thicknesses, showed no survival benefit with ELND. The Inter-group Melanoma Surgical Trial, on the other hand, showed improvement in survival in patients younger than 60 years old with intermediate thickness lesions (1.0 to 4.0 mm) on any anatomic site.77
      
      However, any possible benefit of ELND needs to be weighed against the known significant morbidity of resultant lymphedema. Thus, the question remains as how to best identify those patients with occult disease in whom distant spread has not yet developed and where nodal dissection may be helpful.
      
      Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection may prove to be an answer to this question. The SLN is defined as the first node in the lymphatic basin to which the primary melanoma drains. Theoretically, the histology of the SLN should reflect the histology of the basin in that a negative SLN should rule out nodal disease. SLN can be accurately identified with 96% sensitivity using a combination of blue dye mapping and radiolymphoscintigraphy.85-87 The specificity of these techniques, however, needs to be carefully examined.
      
      Currently, it appears that detection of melanoma in the sentinel node identifies those patients at higher risk of metastasis and therefore those who may benefit from complete lymph node dissection or adjuvant therapy. In the future, the combination of SLN dissection with molecular diagnostic techniques may provide increased sensitivity in identifying patients at high risk for metastasis.17, 88
      
      Table Table 2. Promising Modalities for Treatment of Advanced Melanoma
      image
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): PCR may play an increasingly important role in identifying melanoma-positive lymph nodes in the future. In one study, recurrence rates and disease-free survival were significantly different in node-negative PCR-positive patients compared with node-negative PCR-negative patients.17
      
      The results suggested that use of the PCR assay for detection of submicroscopic melanoma metastases in SLN improved the prediction of disease recurrence and overall survival over routine pathological examination. However, the clinical significance of PCR positive-histologically negative nodes is yet to be determined. Longer longitudinal follow-up for these patients is needed.
      
      ADJUVANT THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES
      Nonsurgical modalities used in the treatment of advanced disease include chemotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the form of biologic response modifiers and melanoma vaccines (Table 2).
      
      Chemotherapy
      Chemotherapeutic approaches to treating melanoma have been uniformly disappointing. Dacarbazine (DTIC) remains the only chemotherapeutic agent approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.80 No single chemotherapeutic agent currently offers response rates greater than 25%. Side effects of DTIC may include myelosuppression, nausea, and emesis.
      
      Various combination regimens including BOLD (bleomycin, vincristine, CCNU, DTIC), CVD (cisplatin, vinblastine, DTIC), and CBDT (cisplatin, BCNU, DTIC, tamoxifen) have been studied in numerous trials and have been associated with response rates ranging from 9% to 55%.73, 80-91 An imidazotetrazine oral agent, temozolamide, was recently shown to be as effective as DTIC in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.92 Advantages potentially include convenient dosing and relatively fewer side effects. The challenge for the oncologist in the future will be to identify which combination of chemotherapeutic agents, if any, will offer consistent improvement over DTIC alone.
      
      Exciting advances have been made and continue to be made in the area of biological response modifiers.
      
      Interferon alpha 2b (IFNα2b)
      IFNα2b is currently FDA approved for the treatment of stage IIB and stage III melanoma. In the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial 1684, high-dose IFNα2b treatment for one year resulted in prolongation of survival from 2.8 to 3.8 years and prolongation of the relapse-free interval from 1.0 to 1.7 years.93, 94 A subsequent trial showed significantly increased disease-free survival but no increase in overall survival. It must be emphasized, however, that treatment with INFα 2b is associated with significant toxicity.
      
      In the future, IFNα may have a role as an adjunct to vaccine therapy. Trials are currently underway to determine, for example, whether anti-GM2 antibody responses are diminished or enhanced when IFNα2b is administered with or following initiation of vaccination with GMK. A commercial vaccine preparation from cultured tumor cell lines given with Detox (monophosphoryl lipid-A) has been shown to induce antitumor responses among patients with metastatic melanoma.95 Limited data from a pilot study suggest improved responses among patients who have also received IFNα 2b.
      
      Interferon gamma (IFNγ)
      IFNγ was not effective in phase I or phase II trials of metastatic melanoma but remains potentially attractive due to immunomodulatory effects on natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, macrophage activation, and HLA class II antigen expression.96-98
      
      Interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      IL-2 has been used to treat melanoma.99, 100 Early studies showed that high-dose IL-2, either alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, produced responses in 15% to 20% of patients, with complete responses observed in 4% to 6%. Median response duration was reported to be 6.5 months, with 60% of complete responders free of disease progression at five years. High-dose administration of IL-2 appears to be superior to low doses, although high doses are associated with significant toxicity. Adverse effects of high-dose IL-2 include hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary edema, fever, increased capillary permeability, sepsis, and death. Further studies will be required to assess the potential role of IL-2 in the management of advanced melanoma.101
      
      Biochemotherapy
      Therapies based on biological response modifiers remain attractive due to the potential durability of complete responses rather than to the magnitude of the overall response rate. Initial studies indicate that 5% to 10% of complete responses may be durable.94, 102 Biochemotherapy holds promise as a therapeutic option for melanoma beyond the year 2000 and is based on the distinct mechanisms, as well as toxicities, of agents used.
      
      Results of a recent ECOG randomized phase III trial failed to show benefit when IFNα was added to DTIC.102-107 More promising findings were described, however, in several trials using IL-2, or both IL-2 and IFNα in combination with various chemotherapy regimens, with response rates ranging from 37% to 63%. The highest response rates have been reported by Legha et al and Buzaid et al using CVD in combination with IL-2 and IFNα, either sequentially or concurrently (61% and 63%, respectively).103-107 The main disadvantage of biochemotherapy is its associated toxicity.
      
      Histologic partial regression of malignant melanoma has been documented in up to 20% of cases and, in rare cases, even complete spontaneous regression has been observed.
      
      Immunotherapy
      Another area of active research in melanoma therapy involves vaccine development. Histologic partial regression of malignant melanoma has been documented in up to 20% of cases and, in rare cases, even complete spontaneous regression has been observed. The hypothesis that such regression may be associated with vitiligo provides a rational basis for melanocyte antigen-directed immunotherapy.108 Successful active specific immunotherapy would provide a host with tumor antigen in the correct context to allow generation of an immune response.109, 110
      
      Melanoma antigens may be categorized as either peptides or ganglio-sides.111-115 peptide antigens include MAGE-1, MAGE-3, GAGE, BAGE, tyrosinase, melan-A/MART-1, gp100, and gp75. Ganglioside antigens include GM2, GD2, DG3, and 9-O-acetyl-GD3.
      
      The study of carbohydrate antigens is also an area of active interest and investigation. Previous studies indicated a survival advantage in patients with naturally occurring antibodies against the GM2 ganglioside. Results of a randomized trial in American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III patients showed prolonged disease-free intervals (23%) and increased survival rates (14%) in patients receiving GM2/BCG vaccine versus BCG alone.116
      
      Vaccination with treated autologous cells has been attempted.117-119 Although studies with LAK cells showed little advantage over those that used IL-2 alone, dendritic cell targeted therapy may be promising. Dendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells involved in infectious and neoplastic host defense.118 Recent innovations allow for the generation of high numbers of dendritic cells from relatively small volumes of peripheral blood.
      
      In a recent study, dendritic cells from 16 patients with stage IV melanoma were pulsed with autologous tumor lysate or specific antigenic peptides and then reinjected.119 Results yielded two partial and two complete responses in the 16 patients. Further studies of dendritic cell-based vaccine therapy are warranted.
      
      Gene Therapy
      An exciting new area of research involves gene therapy.80, 120, 121 One strategy involves the transfection of retrovirus-mediated herpes simplex type 1 thymidine kinase suicide genes. In a phase I/II study, retrovirus vector producing M11 cells were injected into cutaneous malignant melanoma nodules, rendering the transfected cells susceptible to ganciclovir. Patients were then treated with ganciclovir following a seven-day trans-duction period. Tumor size was moderately affected and tumor necrosis was noted histologically.
      
      In another study, autologous tumor cells transfected with IL-2 genes were injected back into patients with the hope of generating an immune response.122 Anti-tumor delayed-type hypersensitivity and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes were generated in some patients. Yet another approach involved injection of vaccinia/GM-CSF constructs directly into subcutaneous metastases.123 Immune responses were generated and a partial response was noted in one of seven patients.
      
      Summary
      Despite potentially exciting developments in the treatment of advanced malignant melanoma, prevention and early detection remain the primary goals in the war against this cancer as we enter the new century. With improved professional education, public awareness, patient education, and research advances, we may be able to decrease the incidence and mortality of malignant melanoma. As incidence continues to rise, however, our best weapon against this potentially deadly neoplasm is a multidisciplinary approach using the best skills of all involved."

      "Content": "Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocytes (the cells that give the skin its tan or brown color) start to grow out of control.

      Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can then spread to other areas of the body. To learn more about cancer and how it starts and spreads, see What Is Cancer?
      
      Melanoma is much less common than some other types of skin cancers. But melanoma is more dangerous because it’s much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.

      Where do skin cancers start?
      Most skin cancers start in the top layer of skin, called the epidermis. There are 3 main types of cells in this layer:
      
      Squamous cells: These are flat cells in the upper (outer) part of the epidermis, which are constantly shed as new ones form.
      Basal cells: These cells are in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer. These cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off the skin’s surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells.
      Melanocytes: These are the cells that can become melanoma. They normally make a brown pigment called melanin, which gives the skin its tan or brown color. Melanin protects the deeper layers of the skin from some of the harmful effects of the sun.
      The epidermis is separated from the deeper layers of skin by the basement membrane. When a skin cancer becomes more advanced, it generally grows through this barrier and into the deeper layers.
      
      Melanoma skin cancers
      Melanoma is a cancer that begins in the melanocytes. Other names for this cancer include malignant melanoma and cutaneous melanoma. Most melanoma cells still make melanin, so melanoma tumors are usually brown or black. But some melanomas do not make melanin and can appear pink, tan, or even white.
      
      Melanomas can develop anywhere on the skin, but they are more likely to start on the trunk (chest and back) in men and on the legs in women. The neck and face are other common sites.
      
      Having darkly pigmented skin lowers your risk of melanoma at these more common sites, but anyone can get melanoma on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails. Melanomas in these areas make up a much larger portion of melanomas in African Americans than in whites.
      
      Melanomas can also form in other parts of your body, such as the eyes, mouth, genitals, and anal area, but these are much less common than melanoma of the skin.
      
      Melanoma is much less common than some other types of skin cancer. But melanoma is more dangerous because it’s much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.
      
      Other types of skin cancer
      There are many other types of skin cancer. Skin cancers that are not melanomas are sometimes grouped as non-melanoma skin cancers because they develop from skin cells other than melanocytes. They tend to behave very differently from melanomas and are often treated with different methods.
      
      Basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers
      Basal cell and squamous cell cancers are by far the most common skin cancers, and actually are more common than any other form of cancer. Because they rarely spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are usually less concerning and are treated differently from melanoma. These cancers are discussed in Basal and Squamous Cell Skin Cancer.
      
      Less common skin cancers
      Other types of non-melanoma skin cancer are much less common than basal and squamous cell cancers and are treated differently. They include:
      
      Merkel cell carcinoma
      Kaposi sarcoma
      Cutaneous (skin) lymphoma
      Skin adnexal tumors (tumors that start in hair follicles or skin glands)
      Various types of sarcomas
      Together, these types account for less than 1% of all skin cancers.
      
      Benign skin tumors
      Many types of benign (non-cancerous) tumors can develop from different types of skin cells.

      A mole (nevus) is a benign skin tumor that develops from melanocytes. Almost everyone has some moles. Nearly all moles (nevi) are harmless, but having some types can raise your risk of melanoma. See Risk Factors for Melanoma Skin Cancer for more information about moles.
      
      A Spitz nevus is a kind of mole that sometimes looks like melanoma. It’s more common in children and teens, but it can also be seen in adults. These tumors are typically benign and don’t spread. But sometimes doctors have trouble telling Spitz nevi from true melanomas, even when looking at them under a microscope. Therefore, they are often removed, just to be safe.
      
      Benign tumors that develop from other types of skin cells
      Seborrheic keratoses: tan, brown, or black raised spots with a “waxy” texture
      Hemangiomas: benign blood vessel growths, often called strawberry spots
      Lipomas: soft growths made up of fat cells
      Warts: rough-surfaced growths caused by some types of human papilloma virus (HPV)
      Most of these tumors rarely, if ever, turn into cancers. There are many other kinds of benign skin tumors, but most are not very common."

      "Content": "It's common to have different specialists or health care professionals as part of your cancer care team. In fact, having different professionals work together is an approach that is used in many hospitals and clinics before, during, and after cancer treatment. Some of these professionals have had extra training that focused on:

      A certain type of cancer
      A type of cancer treatment
      A specific area, system, or part of the body,
      Health problems related to cancer
      Managing (coordinating) the cancer patient's care.
      Don’t be afraid to ask the people on your team what their role is, what kind of training they’ve had, and what part of your care or treatment they’ll be providing. Knowing how your care team works and how they communicate with each other will help you and your loved ones understand who can help with certain problems that may come up.

      "Content": "A risk factor is anything that raises your risk of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking and excess sun exposure, can be changed. Others, like your age or family history, can’t be changed.

      Having a risk factor, or even many risk factors, does not mean that you will get melanoma. Many people with risk factors never get melanoma. And some people who get it may have few or no known risk factors.
      
      Still, it’s important to know about the risk factors for melanoma because there may be things you can do to lower your risk of getting it. If you are at higher risk because of certain factors, there are also things you can do that might help find it early, when it’s likely to be easier to treat.
      
      Several risk factors can make a person more likely to develop melanoma.
      
      Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure
      Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays is a major risk factor for most melanomas. Sunlight is the main source of UV rays. Tanning beds and sun lamps are also sources of UV rays.
      
      While UV rays make up only a very small portion of the sun’s rays, they are the main cause of the damaging effects of the sun on the skin. UV rays damage the DNA (genes) inside skin cells. Skin cancers can begin when this damage affects the DNA of genes that control skin cell growth.
      
      The pattern and timing of the UV exposure may play a role in melanoma development. For example, melanoma on the trunk (chest and back) and legs has been linked to frequent sunburns (especially in childhood). This might also have something to do with the fact that these areas aren't constantly exposed to UV light. Some evidence suggests that melanomas that start in these areas are different from those that start on the face, neck, and arms, where the sun exposure is more constant. And different from either of these are melanomas on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails (known as acral lentiginous melanomas), or on internal surfaces such as the mouth and vagina (mucosal melanomas), where there has been little or no sun exposure.
      
      To learn more about the effects of UV rays on the skin and what you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones, see Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation and How Do I Protect Myself from Ultraviolet (UV) Rays?
      
      Moles
      A mole (also known as a nevus) is a benign (non-cancerous) pigmented tumor. Babies are not usually born with moles; they often begin to appear in children and young adults.
      
      Having many moles: Most moles will never cause any problems, but someone who has many moles is more likely to develop melanoma.
      
      Atypical moles (dysplastic nevi): These moles look a little like normal moles but also have some features of melanoma. They are often larger than other moles and have an abnormal shape or color. (See Signs and Symptoms of Melanoma Skin Cancer for descriptions of how moles and melanomas look.) They can appear on skin that is exposed to the sun as well as skin that is usually covered, such as on the buttocks or scalp.
      
      Dysplastic nevi often run in families. A small percentage of dysplastic nevi may develop into melanomas. But most dysplastic nevi never become cancer, and many melanomas seem to arise without a pre-existing dysplastic nevus.
      
      Dysplastic nevus syndrome (atypical mole syndrome): People with this inherited condition have many dysplastic nevi. If at least one close relative has had melanoma, this condition is referred to as familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome, or FAMMM.
      
      People with this condition have a very high lifetime risk of melanoma, so they need to have very thorough, regular skin exams by a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin problems). Sometimes full body photos are taken to help the doctor recognize if moles are changing and growing. Many doctors recommend that these patients be taught to do monthly skin self-exams as well.
      
      Congenital melanocytic nevi: Moles present at birth are called congenital melanocytic nevi. The lifetime risk of melanoma developing in congenital melanocytic nevi is estimated to be between 0 and 5%, depending on the size of the nevus. People with very large congenital nevi have a higher risk, while the risk is lower for those with small nevi. For example, the risk for melanoma is very low in congenital nevi smaller than the palm of the hand, while those that cover large portions of back and buttocks (“bathing trunk nevi”) have significantly higher risks.
      
      Congenital nevi are sometimes removed by surgery so that they don’t have a chance to become cancer. Whether doctors advise removing a congenital nevus depends on several factors including its size, location, and color. Many doctors recommend that congenital nevi that are not removed should be examined regularly by a dermatologist and that the patient should be taught how to do monthly skin self-exams.
      
      Again, the chance of any single mole turning into cancer is very low. However, anyone with lots of irregular or large moles has an increased risk for melanoma.
      
      Fair skin, freckling, and light hair
      The risk of melanoma is much higher for whites than for African Americans. Whites with red or blond hair, blue or green eyes, or fair skin that freckles or burns easily are at increased risk.
      
      Family history of melanoma
      Your risk of melanoma is higher if one or more of your first-degree relatives (parents, brothers, sisters, or children) has had melanoma. Around 10% of all people with melanoma have a family history of the disease.
      
      The increased risk might be because of a shared family lifestyle of frequent sun exposure, a family tendency to have fair skin, certain gene changes (mutations) that run in a family, or a combination of these factors.
      
      Most experts don’t recommend that people with a family history of melanoma have genetic testing to look for mutations that might increase risk, as it’s not yet clear how helpful this is. Rather, experts advise that they do the following:
      
      Have regular skin exams by a dermatologist
      Thoroughly examine their own skin once a month
      Be particularly careful about sun protection and avoiding manmade UV rays (such as those from tanning beds)
      Personal history of melanoma or other skin cancers
      A person who has already had melanoma has a higher risk of getting melanoma again. People who have had basal or squamous cell skin cancers are also at increased risk of getting melanoma.
      
      Having a weakened immune system
      A person’s immune system helps fight cancers of the skin and other organs. People with weakened immune systems (from certain diseases or medical treatments) are more likely to develop many types of skin cancer, including melanoma.
      
      For example, people who get organ transplants are usually given medicines that weaken their immune system to help prevent them from rejecting the new organ. This increases their risk of melanoma.
      
      People infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, often have weakened immune systems and are also at increased risk for melanoma.
      
      Being older
      Melanoma is more likely to occur in older people, but it is also found in younger people. In fact, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people younger than 30 (especially younger women). Melanoma that runs in families may occur at a younger age.
      
      Being male
      In the United States, men have a higher rate of melanoma than women, although this varies by age. Before age 50, the risk is higher for women; after age 50 the risk is higher in men.
      
      Xeroderma pigmentosum
      Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, inherited condition that affects skin cells’ ability to repair damage to their DNA. People with XP have a high risk of developing melanoma and other skin cancers when they are young, especially on sun-exposed areas of their skin."

      "Content": "Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays (such as x-rays) or particles to kill cancer cells.

      When might radiation therapy be used?
      Radiation therapy is not needed for most people with melanoma on the skin, although it might be useful in certain situations:
      
      It might be an option to treat very early stage melanomas, if surgery can't be done for some reason.
      Radiation can also be used after surgery for an uncommon type of melanoma known as desmoplastic melanoma.
      Sometimes, radiation is given after surgery in the area where lymph nodes were removed, especially if many of the nodes contained cancer cells. This is to try to lower the chance that the cancer will come back.
      Radiation can be used to treat melanoma that has come back after surgery, either in the skin or lymph nodes, or to help treat distant spread of the disease.
      Radiation therapy is often used to relieve symptoms caused by the spread of the melanoma, especially to the brain or bones. Treatment with the goal of relieving symptoms is called palliative therapy. Palliative radiation therapy is not expected to cure the cancer, but it might help shrink it or slow its growth for a time to help control some of the symptoms.
      How is radiation therapy given?
      The type of radiation most often used to treat melanoma, known as external beam radiation therapy, focuses radiation from a source outside of the body on the cancer.
      
      The treatment schedule can vary based on the goal of treatment and where the melanoma is. Before treatments start, your radiation team will take careful measurements to find the correct angles for aiming the radiation beams and the proper dose of radiation. This planning session is called simulation.
      
      Treatment is much like getting an x-ray, but the radiation is stronger. The procedure itself is painless. Each treatment lasts only a few minutes, although the setup time – getting you into place for treatment – usually takes longer.
      
      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
      SRS is a type of radiation therapy that can sometimes be used for tumors that have spread to the brain. (Despite the name, there is no actual surgery.) High doses of radiation are aimed precisely at the tumor(s) in one or more treatment sessions. There are 2 main ways to give SRS:
      
      In one version, a machine called a Gamma Knife® focuses about 200 thin beams of radiation on the tumor from different angles over a few minutes to hours. The head is kept in the same position by placing it in a rigid frame.
      In another version, a linear accelerator (a machine that creates radiation) that is controlled by a computer moves around the head to deliver radiation to the tumor from many different angles over a few minutes. The head is kept in place with a head frame or a plastic face mask.
      These treatments can be repeated if needed.
      
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
      This approach is similar to SRS (using a linear accelerator), but it can be used to treat tumors in other parts of the body.
      
      Possible side effects of radiation therapy
      Side effects of radiation are usually limited to the area getting radiation. Common side effects can include:
      
      Sunburn-like skin problems
      Changes in skin color
      Hair loss where the radiation enters the body
      Fatigue
      Nausea (if radiation is aimed at the abdomen)
      Often these go away after treatment.
      
      Radiation therapy to the brain can sometimes cause memory loss, headaches, trouble thinking, or reduced sexual desire. Usually these symptoms are minor compared with those caused by a tumor in the brain, but they might still affect your quality of life.

      When might chemo be used?
      Chemo might be used to treat advanced melanoma after other treatments have been tried, but it’s not often used as the first treatment because newer forms of immunotherapy and targeted drugs are typically more effective. Chemo is usually not as helpful for melanoma as it is for some other types of cancer, but it can shrink tumors in some people.
      
      Which chemo drugs are used to treat melanoma?
      Several chemo drugs can be used to treat melanoma:
      
      Dacarbazine (also called DTIC)
      Temozolomide
      Nab-paclitaxel
      Paclitaxel
      Cisplatin
      Carboplatin
      Some of these drugs are given alone, while others are more often combined with other drugs. It’s not clear if using combinations of drugs is more helpful than using a single drug, but it can add to the side effects.
      
      Doctors give chemo in cycles, with each period of treatment followed by a rest period to give the body time to recover. Each chemo cycle typically lasts for a few weeks.
      
      Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) and isolated limb infusion (ILI): These are ways of giving chemotherapy that are sometimes used to treat melanoma that is confined to an arm or leg but that can't be removed with surgery. The idea with this approach is to keep the chemo in the limb and not allow it to reach other parts of the body, where it could cause more side effects.
      
      This is done during a surgical procedure. The blood flow of the arm or leg is separated from the rest of the body, and a high dose of chemotherapy is circulated through the limb for a short period of time. This lets doctors give high doses to the area of the tumor without exposing other parts of the body to these doses.
      
      To do this, a tube is placed into the artery that feeds blood into the limb, and a second tube is placed into the vein that drains blood from it.
      
      For ILP, the artery and vein are first surgically separated from the circulation to the rest of the body, and are then hooked up to tubes going to a special machine in the operating room.
      For ILI, long tubes (catheters) are inserted through the skin and into the artery and vein. This method is less complex and takes less time, and it might not require general anesthesia (where you are in a deep sleep).
      In either case, a tourniquet is tied around the limb to help make sure the chemo doesn’t enter the rest of the body. Chemotherapy (usually with a drug called melphalan) is infused into the blood in the limb through the artery. (This is done by the machine in ILP, and by using a syringe in ILI.) During the treatment session, the blood exits the limb through the tube in the vein, the chemo is added, and then the blood is returned back to the limb through the tube in the artery. (During ILP, the drug can also be heated by the machine to help the chemo work better.) By the end of the treatment the drug is washed out of the limb, and the tubes are removed (and for ILP the blood vessels are stitched back together) so that the circulation is returned to normal.
      
      Possible side effects of chemotherapy
      Chemo drugs can cause side effects. These depend on the type and dose of drugs given and how long they are used. The side effects of chemo can include:
      
      Hair loss
      Mouth sores
      Loss of appetite
      Nausea and vomiting
      Diarrhea or constipation
      Increased risk of infection (from having too few white blood cells)
      Easy bruising or bleeding (from having too few blood platelets)
      Fatigue (from having too few red blood cells)
      These side effects usually go away once treatment is finished. There are often ways to lessen side effects. For example, drugs can help prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting. Be sure to ask your doctor or nurse about drugs to help reduce side effects.
      
      Some chemo drugs can have other side effects. For example, some drugs can damage nerves, which can lead to symptoms (mainly in the hands and feet) such as pain, burning or tingling sensations, sensitivity to cold or heat, or weakness. This condition is called peripheral neuropathy. It usually goes away once treatment is stopped, but for some people it can last a long time.
      
      Be sure to talk with your cancer care team about what to expect in terms of side effects. While you are getting chemo, report any side effects to your medical team so that they can be treated promptly. In some cases, the doses of chemo may need to be reduced or treatment may need to be delayed or stopped to prevent side effects from getting worse."

      "Content": "These drugs target parts of melanoma cells that make them different from normal cells. Targeted drugs work differently from standard chemotherapy drugs, which basically attack any quickly dividing cells.

      Targeted drugs can be very helpful in treating melanomas that have certain gene changes.
      
      Drugs that target cells with BRAF gene changes
      About half of all melanomas have changes (mutations) in the BRAF gene. Melanoma cells with these changes make an altered BRAF protein that helps them grow. Some drugs target this and related proteins, such as the MEK proteins.
      
      If you have melanoma that has spread beyond the skin, a biopsy sample of it will likely be tested to see if the cancer cells have a BRAF mutation. Drugs that target the BRAF protein (BRAF inhibitors) or the MEK proteins (MEK inhibitors) aren’t likely to work on melanomas that have a normal BRAF gene.
      
      Most often, if a person has a BRAF mutation and needs targeted therapy, they will get both a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor, as combining these drugs often works better than either one alone.
      
      BRAF inhibitors
      Vemurafenib (Zelboraf), dabrafenib (Tafinlar), and encorafenib (Braftovi) are drugs that attack the BRAF protein directly.
      
      These drugs can shrink or slow the growth of tumors in some people whose melanoma has spread or can’t be removed completely.
      
      Dabrafenib can also be used (along with the MEK inhibitor trametinib; see below) after surgery in people with stage III melanoma, where it can help lower the risk of the cancer coming back.
      
      These drugs are taken as pills or capsules, once or twice a day.
      
      Common side effects can include skin thickening, rash, itching, sensitivity to the sun, headache, fever, joint pain, fatigue, hair loss, and nausea. Less common but serious side effects can include heart rhythm problems, liver problems, kidney failure, severe allergic reactions, severe skin or eye problems, bleeding, and increased blood sugar levels.
      
      Some people treated with these drugs develop new squamous cell skin cancers. These cancers are usually less serious than melanoma and can be treated by removing them. Still, your doctor will want to check your skin often during treatment and for several months afterward. You should also let your doctor know right away if you notice any new growths or abnormal areas on your skin.
      
      MEK inhibitors
      The MEK gene works together with the BRAF gene, so drugs that block MEK proteins can also help treat melanomas with BRAF gene changes. MEK inhibitors include trametinib (Mekinist), cobimetinib (Cotellic), and binimetinib (Mektovi).
      
      These drugs can be used to treat melanoma that has spread or can’t be removed completely.
      
      Trametinib can also be used along with dabrafenib after surgery in people with stage III melanoma, where it can help lower the risk of the cancer coming back.
      
      Again, the most common approach is to combine a MEK inhibitor with a BRAF inhibitor. This seems to shrink tumors for longer periods of time than using either type of drug alone. Some side effects (such as the development of other skin cancers) are actually less common with the combination.
      
      MEK inhibitors are pills taken once or twice a day.
      
      Common side effects can include rash, nausea, diarrhea, swelling, and sensitivity to sunlight. Rare but serious side effects can include heart lung, or liver damage; bleeding or blood clots; vision problems; muscle damage; and skin infections.
      
      Drugs that target cells with C-KIT gene changes
      A small portion of melanomas have changes in the C-KIT gene that help them grow. These changes are more common in melanomas that start in certain parts of the body:
      
      On the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails (known as acral melanomas)
      Inside the mouth or other mucosal (wet) areas
      In areas that get chronic sun exposure
      Some targeted drugs, such as imatinib (Gleevec) and nilotinib (Tasigna), can affect cells with changes in C-KIT. If you have an advanced melanoma that started in one of these places, your doctor may test your melanoma cells for changes in the C-KIT gene, which might mean that one of these drugs could be helpful.
      
      Drugs that target different gene changes are also being studied in clinical trials (see What’s New in Melanoma Skin Cancer Research?).

      "Category": "treatment",
      "Content": "Immunotherapy is the use of medicines to help a person’s own immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively. Several types of immunotherapy can be used to treat melanoma.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors
      An important part of the immune system is its ability to keep itself from attacking normal cells in the body. To do this, it uses “checkpoints,” which are proteins on immune cells that need to be turned on (or off) to start an immune response. Melanoma cells sometimes use these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. But these drugs target the checkpoint proteins, helping to restore the immune response against melanoma cells.
      
      PD-1 inhibitors
      Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo) are drugs that target PD-1, a protein on immune system cells called T cells that normally help keep these cells from attacking other cells in the body. By blocking PD-1, these drugs boost the immune response against melanoma cells. This can often shrink tumors and help people live longer.
      
      They can be used to treat melanomas:
      
      That can’t be removed by surgery
      That have spread to other parts of the body
      After surgery (as adjuvant treatment) for certain stage II or III melanomas to try to lower the risk of the cancer coming back
      These drugs are given as an intravenous (IV) infusion, typically every 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the drug and why it's being given. 
      
      PD-L1 inhibitor
      Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) is a drug that targets PD-L1, a protein related to PD-1 that is found on some tumor cells and immune cells. Blocking this protein can help boost the immune response against melanoma cells.
      
      This drug can be used along with cobimetinib and vemurafenib in people with melanoma that has the BRAF gene mutation, when the cancer can’t be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.
      
      This drug is given as an intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 to 4 weeks.
      
      CTLA-4 inhibitor
      Ipilimumab (Yervoy) is another drug that boosts the immune response, but it has a different target. It blocks CTLA-4, another protein on T cells that normally helps keep them in check.
      
      It can be used to treat melanomas that can’t be removed by surgery or that have spread to other parts of the body. It might also be used for less advanced melanomas after surgery (as an adjuvant treatment) in some situations, to try to lower the risk of the cancer coming back.
      
      When used alone, this drug doesn’t seem to shrink as many tumors as the PD-1 inhibitors, and it tends to have more serious side effects, so usually one of those other drugs is used first. Another option in some situations might be to combine this drug with one of the PD-1 inhibitors. This can increase the chance of shrinking the tumors (slightly more than a PD-1 inhibitor alone), but it can also increase the risk of side effects.
      
      This drug is given as an intravenous (IV) infusion, usually once every 3 weeks for 4 treatments (although it may be given for longer when used as an adjuvant treatment). 
      
      LAG-3 inhibitor
      Relatlimab targets LAG-3, another checkpoint protein on certain immune cells that normally helps keep the immune system in check.
      
      This drug is given along with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (in a combination known as Opdualag). It can be used to treat melanomas that can’t be removed by surgery or that have spread to other parts of the body. 
      
      This drug is given as an intravenous (IV) infusion, typically once every 4 weeks.
      
      Possible side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors
      Some of the more common side effects of these drugs can include fatigue, cough, nausea, skin rash, poor appetite, constipation, joint pain, and diarrhea.
      
      Other, more serious side effects occur less often.
      
      Infusion reactions: Some people might have an infusion reaction while getting these drugs. This is like an allergic reaction, and can include fever, chills, flushing of the face, rash, itchy skin, feeling dizzy, wheezing, and trouble breathing. It’s important to tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of these symptoms while getting these drugs.
      
      Autoimmune reactions: These drugs remove one of the safeguards on the body's immune system. Sometimes the immune system responds by attacking other parts of the body, which can cause serious or even life-threatening problems in the lungs, intestines, liver, hormone-making glands, kidneys, or other organs.
      
      It’s very important to report any new side effects to someone on your health care team as soon as possible. If serious side effects do occur, treatment may need to be stopped and you might be given high doses of corticosteroids to suppress your immune system.
      
      Interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      Interleukins are proteins that certain cells in the body make to boost the immune system in a general way. Lab-made versions of interleukin-2 (IL-2) are sometimes used to treat melanoma. They are given as intravenous (IV) infusions, at least at first. Some patients or caregivers may be able to learn how to give injections under the skin at home.
      
      For advanced melanomas: IL-2 can sometimes shrink advanced melanomas when used alone. It is not used as much as in the past, because the immune checkpoint inhibitors are more likely to help people and tend to have fewer side effects. But IL-2 might be an option if these drugs are no longer working.
      
      Side effects of IL-2 can include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, aches, severe tiredness, drowsiness, and low blood cell counts. In high doses, IL-2 can cause fluid to build up in the body so that the person swells up and can feel quite sick. Because of this and other possible serious side effects, high-dose IL-2 is given only in the hospital, in centers that have experience with this type of treatment.
      
      For some earlier-stage melanomas: Melanomas that have reached the nearby lymph nodes are more likely to come back in another part of the body, even if all of the cancer is thought to have been removed. IL-2 can sometimes be injected into the tumors (known as intralesional therapy) to try to prevent this. Side effects are similar but tend to be milder when IL-2 is injected directly into the tumor.
      
      When deciding whether to use IL-2, patients and their doctors need to take into account the potential benefits and side effects of this treatment.
      
      Oncolytic virus therapy
      Viruses are a type of germ that can infect and kill cells. Some viruses can be altered in the lab so that they infect and kill mainly cancer cells. These are known as oncolytic viruses. Along with killing the cells directly, the viruses can also alert the immune system to attack the cancer cells.
      
      Talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic), also known as T-VEC, is an oncolytic virus that can be used to treat melanomas in the skin or lymph nodes that can’t be removed with surgery. The virus is injected directly into the tumors, typically every 2 weeks. This treatment can sometimes shrink these tumors, and might also shrink tumors in other parts of the body.
      
      Side effects can include flu-like symptoms and pain at the injection site.
      
      Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine
      BCG is a germ related to the one that causes tuberculosis. BCG doesn’t cause serious disease in humans, but it does activate the immune system. The BCG vaccine can be used to help treat stage III melanomas by injecting it directly into tumors, although it isn't used very often.
      
      Imiquimod cream
      Imiquimod (Zyclara) is a drug that is put on the skin as a cream. It stimulates a local immune response against skin cancer cells. For very early (stage 0) melanomas in sensitive areas on the face, some doctors may use imiquimod if surgery might be disfiguring. It might also be an option for some melanomas that have spread along the skin.
      
      The cream is usually applied 2 to 5 times a week for around 3 months. Some people have serious skin reactions to this drug. Imiquimod is not used for more advanced melanomas.
      
      Newer treatments
      Some other types of immunotherapy have shown promise in treating melanoma in early studies. Other studies are now looking at combining different types of immunotherapy to see if it might help them work better. (See What’s New in Melanoma Skin Cancer Research?)

      "Content": "Surgery is the main treatment option for most melanomas, and usually cures early-stage melanomas.

      Wide excision
      When melanoma is diagnosed by skin biopsy, more surgery will probably be needed to help make sure the cancer has been removed (excised) completely. This fairly minor operation will cure most thin melanomas.
      
      Local anesthesia is injected into the area to numb it before the excision. The site of the tumor is then cut out, along with a small amount of normal skin around the edges (called the margin). The wound is usually stitched back together afterward. This will leave a scar.
      
      The removed sample is then viewed with a microscope to make sure that no cancer cells were left behind at the edges of the skin that was removed.
      
      Wide excision differs from an excisional biopsy. The margins are wider because the diagnosis is already known. The recommended margins vary depending on the thickness of the tumor. Thicker tumors need larger margins (both at the edges and in the depth of the excision).
      
      The margins can also vary based on where the melanoma is on the body and other factors. For example, if the melanoma is on the face, the margins may be smaller to avoid large scars or other problems. Smaller margins might increase the risk of the cancer coming back, so be sure to discuss the options with your doctor.
      
      Mohs surgery
      In some situations, Mohs surgery (also known as Mohs micrographic surgery, or MMS) might be an option. This type of surgery is used more often for some other types of skin cancer, but not all doctors agree on using it for melanoma.
      
      Mohs surgery is done by a specially trained dermatologist or surgeon. In this procedure, the skin (including the melanoma) is removed in very thin layers. Each layer is then looked at with a microscope. If cancer cells are seen, the doctor removes another layer of skin. This is repeated until a layer shows no signs of cancer. This is a slow process, often taking several hours, but it means that more normal skin near the tumor can be saved, which can help the area look better after surgery.
      
      Amputation
      In uncommon situations where the melanoma is on a finger or toe and has grown deeply, part or all of that digit might need to be amputated.
      
      Lymph node dissection
      In this operation, the surgeon removes all of the lymph nodes in the region near the primary melanoma tumor. For example, if the melanoma is on a leg, the surgeon would remove the nodes in the groin region on that side of the body, which is where melanoma cells would most likely travel to first.
      
      Once the diagnosis of melanoma is made from the skin biopsy, the doctor will examine the lymph nodes near the melanoma. Depending on the thickness and location of the melanoma, this may be done by physical exam, or by imaging tests (such as ultrasound or CT or PET scans) to look at nodes that are not near the body surface.
      
      If the nearby lymph nodes are abnormally hard or large, and a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy or excisional biopsy finds melanoma in a node or nodes, a lymph node dissection is usually done.
      
      If the lymph nodes are not enlarged, a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done, particularly if the melanoma is thicker than 1 mm. (See Tests for Melanoma Skin Cancer for a description of this procedure.) If the sentinel lymph node does not contain cancer, then there is no need for a lymph node dissection because it’s unlikely the melanoma has spread to the lymph nodes. If the sentinel lymph node contains cancer cells, removing the remaining lymph nodes in that area with a lymph node dissection is usually advised. This is called a completion lymph node dissection.
      
      It’s not clear if a lymph node dissection can cure melanomas that have spread to the nodes. This is still being studied. Still, some doctors feel it might prolong a patient’s life and at least avoid the pain that may be caused by cancer growing in these lymph nodes.
      
      A full lymph node dissection can cause some long-term side effects. One of the most troublesome can be lymphedema. Lymph nodes in the groin or under the arm normally help drain fluid from the limbs. If they are removed, fluid may build up. This can cause limb swelling, which may or may not go away. If severe enough, it can cause skin problems and an increased risk of infections in the limb. Elastic stockings or compression sleeves can help some people with this condition. For more information, see Lymphedema.
      
      Lymphedema, along with the pain from the surgery itself, is a main reason why lymph node dissection is not done unless the doctor feels it is really necessary. Sentinel lymph node biopsy, however, is unlikely to have this effect. It’s important to discuss the risks of side effects with your doctor before having either of these procedures.
      
      Surgery for metastatic melanoma
      If melanoma has spread (metastasized) from the skin to other organs such as the lungs or brain, the cancer is very unlikely to be curable by surgery. Even when only 1 or 2 areas of spread are found by imaging tests such as CT or MRI scans, there are likely to be others that are too small to be found by these scans.
      
      Surgery is sometimes done in these circumstances, but the goal is usually to try to control the cancer rather than to cure it. If 1 or even a few metastases are present and can be removed completely, this surgery may help some people live longer. Removing metastases in some places, such as the brain, might also help prevent or relieve symptoms and improve a person’s quality of life.
      
      If you have metastatic melanoma and your doctor suggests surgery as a treatment option, be sure you understand what the goal of the surgery would be, as well as its possible benefits and risks."

      "Content": "Learning to live with cancer can be stressful. Whether your cancer is gone, or you need to continue
      treatment, you likely have some concerns.
      During and after treatment
      Your doctor will want to watch you
      closely, whether you have finished
      treatment or not. They will want to
      make sure you are getting better and
      that the cancer has not come back.
      Also, your risk for getting a new skin
      cancer on a different part of your body
      is high. So be sure to continue to see
      your doctor.
      Be sure to:
      • Ask your doctor how often you need to be seen.
      • Ask if you will need tests to look for other cancers or check for problems from your treatment.
      • Ask for a list of late- or long-term side effects you should watch for.
      • Ask what to watch for and when you should contact your doctor.
      • Tell your doctor or other people on your
      health care team about any symptoms you
      have so they can help you manage them.
      • Ask for a copy of important medical
      records and a plan for care after treatment.
      Staying healthy
      You can do a lot to keep yourself healthy
      during and after treatment for skin
      cancer. Eating well, being active, and
      staying at a healthy weight can help you
      feel better. Healthy behaviors might also
      lower your risk of getting other cancers.
      There are things you can do to help
      lower your risk of getting a new skin
      cancer or catch a new one early:
      • Protect yourself from getting too much sun.
      • Do not use tobacco products. If you use
      tobacco, try to quit.
      • Check your skin at least once a month.
      Look for changes where your cancer was
      treated. Also look for changes or new spots
      on the rest of your skin.
      • See your doctor regularly for skin exams.
      Skin cancers that are found early are often
      easier to treat.
      Remember to get screened for other kinds of
      cancers and health problems.

You may be relieved to finish treatment, but find it hard not to worry about cancer growing or coming back. (When cancer comes back after treatment, it is called recurrent cancer or a recurrence.) This is very common if you’ve had cancer.

      For some people, the melanoma may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatment with immunotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy, or other treatments to try to help keep the cancer under control for as long as possible. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty.
      
      Follow-up after melanoma
      Even if you’ve completed treatment, your doctors will still want to watch you closely. Along with the risk of the melanoma coming back, people who have had melanoma have a high risk of developing another one, so it’s very important to keep all follow-up appointments. During these visits, your doctors will ask about any problems you are having and may do exams and lab tests or imaging tests to look for signs of cancer or treatment side effects.
      
      Some treatment side effects might last a long time or might not even show up until years after you have finished treatment. Your doctor visits are a good time to ask questions and talk about any changes or problems you notice or concerns you have.
      
      Exams and tests
      Your follow-up schedule should include regular skin and lymph node exams by yourself and by your doctor. How often you need follow-up doctor visits depends on the stage of your melanoma when you were diagnosed and other factors. In addition to the exams, imaging tests such as ultrasounds or CT scans may be recommended for some people.
      
      A typical follow-up schedule for people with early-stage melanomas that were removed completely might call for physical exams every 6 to 12 months for several years. If these exams are normal, the time between your doctor visits may be extended. Your doctor may recommend more frequent exams if you have many moles or atypical moles.
      
      For thicker melanomas or those that had spread beyond the skin, a typical schedule might include physical exams every 3 to 6 months for several years. After that, exams might be done less often. Imaging tests such as ultrasounds or CT scans might be done as well, especially for people who had more advanced stage disease.
      
      It’s also important for melanoma survivors to do regular self-exams of their skin and lymph nodes. Most doctors recommend this at least monthly. You should see your doctor if you find any new lump or change in your skin. You should also report any new symptoms (for example, pain, cough, fatigue, loss of appetite) that don’t go away. Melanoma can sometimes come back many years after it was first treated.
      
      People with melanoma that doesn’t go away completely with treatment will have a follow-up schedule that is based on their specific situation.
      
      Ask your doctor for a survivorship care plan
      Talk with your doctor about developing a survivorship care plan for you. This plan might include:
      
      A suggested schedule for follow-up exams and tests
      A schedule for other tests you might need in the future, such as early detection (screening) tests for other types of cancer, or tests to look for long-term health effects from your cancer or its treatment
      A list of possible late- or long-term side effects from your treatment, including what to watch for and when you should contact your doctor
      Diet and physical activity suggestions
      Keeping health insurance and copies of your medical records
      Even after treatment, it’s very important to keep health insurance. Tests and doctor visits cost a lot, and even though no one wants to think of their cancer coming back, this could happen.
      
      At some point after your cancer treatment, you might find yourself seeing a new doctor who doesn’t know about your medical history. It’s important to keep copies of your medical records to give your new doctor the details of your diagnosis and treatment. Learn more in Keeping Copies of Important Medical Records.
      
      Can I lower my risk of the melanoma progressing or coming back?
      If you have (or have had) melanoma, you probably want to know if there are things you can do that might lower your risk of the cancer coming back, or of getting a new skin cancer.
      
      At this time, not enough is known about melanoma to say for sure if there are things you can do that will be helpful. We do know that people who have had melanoma are at higher risk for developing another melanoma or other type of skin cancer. Because of this, it’s very important to limit your exposure to UV rays (from the sun or tanning beds) and to continue to examine your skin every month for signs of melanoma coming back or possible new skin cancers. Skin cancers that are found early are typically much easier to treat than those found at a later stage.
      
      Adopting healthy behaviors such as not smoking, eating well, being active, and staying at a healthy weight might help as well, but no one knows for sure. However, we do know that these types of changes can have positive effects on your health that can extend beyond your risk of melanoma or other cancers.
      
      About dietary supplements
      So far, no dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, and herbal products) have been shown to clearly help lower the risk of melanoma progressing or coming back. This doesn’t mean that no supplements will help, but it’s important to know that none have been proven to do so.
      
      Dietary supplements are not regulated like medicines in the United States – they do not have to be proven effective (or even safe) before being sold, although there are limits on what they’re allowed to claim they can do. If you are thinking about taking any type of nutritional supplement, talk to your health care team. They can help you decide which ones you can use safely while avoiding those that might be harmful.
      
      If the cancer comes back
      If melanoma does come back at some point, your treatment options will depend on where the cancer is, what treatments you’ve had before, and your overall health. For more on how recurrent cancer is treated, see Treatment of Melanoma Skin Cancer by Stage. For more general information on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence.
      
      Could I get a second cancer after melanoma treatment?
      People who’ve had melanoma can still get other cancers. In fact, melanoma survivors are at higher risk for getting some other types of cancer:
      
      Another skin cancer, including melanoma (this is different from the first cancer coming back)
      Salivary gland cancer
      Small intestine cancer
      Breast cancer (in women)
      Prostate cancer
      Kidney cancer
      Thyroid cancer
      Soft tissue cancer
      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
      The most common second cancer in survivors of skin melanoma is another skin cancer.
      
      There are steps you can take to lower your risk of getting another cancer and stay as healthy as possible. For example, it’s important to limit your exposure to UV rays, which can increase your risk for many types of skin cancer. It’s also important to stay away from tobacco products. Smoking increases the risk of many cancers.
      
      To help maintain good health, melanoma survivors should also:
      
      Get to and stay at a healthy weight
      Keep physically active and limit the time you spend sitting or lying down
      Follow a healthy eating pattern that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limits or avoids red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and highly processed foods
      Not drink alcohol. If you do drink, have no more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 per day for men
      These steps may also lower the risk of other health problems.
      
      Melanoma survivors should also follow the American Cancer Society guidelines for the early detection of cancer, such as those for colorectal and lung cancer. Most experts don’t recommend any other specific tests to look for second cancers unless you have symptoms.
      
      Getting emotional support
      Some amount of feeling depressed, anxious, or worried is normal when melanoma is a part of your life. Some people are affected more than others. But everyone can benefit from help and support from other people, whether friends and family, religious groups, support groups, professional counselors, or others. Learn more in Life After Cancer."

      Skin self-exam
      Although the American Cancer Society does not have guidelines for the early detection of skin cancer, knowing your own skin is important to finding skin cancer early. You should know the pattern of moles, blemishes, freckles, and other marks on your skin so that you’ll notice any new moles or changes in existing moles.
      
      Many doctors recommend checking your own skin, preferably once a month. Skin self-exams are best done in a well-lit room in front of a full-length mirror. Use a hand-held mirror to help look at areas that are hard to see, such as the backs of your thighs. Examine all areas, including your palms and soles, scalp, ears, nails, and your back (in men, the back is a common place for melanomas to start). Friends and family members can also help you with these exams, especially for those hard-to-see areas, such as your scalp and back.
      
      To learn more, see How to Do a Skin Self Exam.
      
      See Signs and Symptoms of Melanoma Skin Cancer to learn about what to look for when examining your skin. Any spots on the skin that are new or changing in size, shape, or color should be seen by a doctor promptly. Be sure to show your doctor any areas that concern you, and ask your doctor to look at areas that may be hard for you to see.
      
      Exam by a health care professional
      Some doctors and other health care professionals do skin exams as part of routine health check-ups.
      
      If your primary doctor finds any unusual moles or other suspicious areas, they may refer you to a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in skin problems. Dermatologists can also do regular skin exams. Many dermatologists use a technique called dermoscopy (also known as dermatoscopy, epiluminescence microscopy [ELM], or surface microscopy) to look at spots on the skin more clearly. A photo of the spot may be taken as well. (See Tests for Melanoma Skin Cancer for more information.)
      
      Regular skin exams are especially important for people who are at higher risk of melanoma, such as people with dysplastic nevus syndrome, people with a strong family history of melanoma, and people who have had melanoma before. If you have many moles, your doctor might advise taking full-body photos so your moles can be tracked over time and new ones can be seen more readily. (This is sometimes called total body photography or mole mapping.) Talk to your doctor about how often you should have your skin examined."

      "Content": "Unusual moles, sores, lumps, blemishes, markings, or changes in the way an area of the skin looks or feels may be a sign of melanoma or another type of skin cancer, or a warning that it might occur.

      Normal moles
      A normal mole is usually an evenly colored brown, tan, or black spot on the skin. It can be either flat or raised. It can be round or oval. Moles are generally less than 6 millimeters (about ¼ inch) across (about the width of a pencil eraser). Some moles can be present at birth, but most appear during childhood or young adulthood. New moles that appear later in life should be checked by a doctor.
      
      Once a mole has developed, it will usually stay the same size, shape, and color for many years. Some moles may eventually fade away.
      
      Most people have moles, and almost all moles are harmless. But it’s important to recognize changes in a mole – such as in its size, shape, color, or texture – that can suggest a melanoma may be developing.
      
      Possible signs and symptoms of melanoma
      The most important warning sign of melanoma is a new spot on the skin or a spot that is changing in size, shape, or color.
      
      Another important sign is a spot that looks different from all of the other spots on your skin (known as the ugly duckling sign).
      
      If you have one of these warning signs, have your skin checked by a doctor.
      
      The ABCDE rule is another guide to the usual signs of melanoma. Be on the lookout and tell your doctor about spots that have any of the following features:
      
      A is for Asymmetry: One half of a mole or birthmark does not match the other.
      B is for Border: The edges are irregular, ragged, notched, or blurred.
      C is for Color: The color is not the same all over and may include different shades of brown or black, or sometimes with patches of pink, red, white, or blue.
      D is for Diameter: The spot is larger than 6 millimeters across (about ¼ inch – the size of a pencil eraser), although melanomas can sometimes be smaller than this.
      E is for Evolving: The mole is changing in size, shape, or color.
      Some melanomas don’t fit these rules. It’s important to tell your doctor about any changes or new spots on the skin, or growths that look different from the rest of your moles.
      
      Other warning signs are:
      
      A sore that doesn’t heal
      Spread of pigment from the border of a spot into surrounding skin
      Redness or a new swelling beyond the border of the mole
      Change in sensation, such as itchiness, tenderness, or pain
      Change in the surface of a mole – scaliness, oozing, bleeding, or the appearance of a lump or bump
      Be sure to show your doctor any areas that concern you and ask your doctor to look at areas that may be hard for you to see. It’s sometimes hard to tell the difference between melanoma and an ordinary mole, even for doctors, so it’s important to show your doctor any mole that you are unsure of.
      
      To see examples of normal moles and melanomas, visit the Skin Cancer Image Gallery on our website.
      
      Remember, too, that a small portion of melanomas start in places other than the skin, such as under a fingernail or toenail, inside the mouth, or even in the colored part of the eye (iris), so it’s important to show a doctor any new or changing spots in these areas as well."

      "Category": "general",
      "Content": "After someone is diagnosed with melanoma, doctors will try to figure out if it has spread, and if so, how far. This process is called staging. The stage of a cancer describes how much cancer is in the body. It helps determine how serious the cancer is and how best to treat it. Doctors also use a cancer's stage when talking about survival statistics.

      The earliest stage melanomas are stage 0 (melanoma in situ), and then range from stages I (1) through IV (4). Some stages are split further, using capital letters (A, B, etc.). As a rule, the lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means cancer has spread more. And within a stage, an earlier letter means a lower stage. Although each person’s cancer experience is unique, cancers with similar stages tend to have a similar outlook and are often treated in much the same way.
      
      How is the stage determined?
      The staging system most often used for melanoma is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system, which is based on 3 key pieces of information:
      
      The extent of the main (primary) tumor (T): How deep has the cancer grown into the skin? Is the cancer ulcerated?
      
      Tumor thickness: The thickness of the melanoma is called the Breslow measurement. In general, melanomas less than 1 millimeter (mm) thick (about 1/25 of an inch) have a very small chance of spreading. As the melanoma becomes thicker, it has a greater chance of spreading.
      Ulceration: Ulceration is a breakdown of the skin over the melanoma. Melanomas that are ulcerated tend to have a worse outlook.
      The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N): Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes?
      
      The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): Has the cancer spread to distant lymph nodes or distant organs ? (Melanoma can spread almost anywhere in the body, but the most common sites of spread are the lungs, liver, brain, bones, and the skin or lymph nodes in other parts of the body.)
      
      Numbers or letters after T, N, and M provide more details about each of these factors. Higher numbers mean the cancer is more advanced. Once a person’s T, N, and M categories have been determined, this information is combined in a process called stage grouping to assign an overall stage. For more information, see Cancer Staging.
      
      The staging system in the table below uses the pathologic stage (also called the surgical stage). This is determined by examining tissue removed during an operation. Sometimes, if surgery is not possible right away (or at all), the cancer will be given a clinical stage instead. This is based on the results of physical exams, biopsies, and imaging tests (as described in Tests for Melanoma Skin Cancer). The clinical stage will be used to help plan treatment. Sometimes, though, the cancer has spread farther than the clinical stage estimates, so it may not predict a person’s outlook as accurately as a pathologic stage. If your cancer has been clinically staged, it is best to talk to your doctor about your specific stage.
      
      The table below is a simplified version of the most recent TNM system, effective as of 2018.
      
      Melanoma staging can be very complex, so if you have any questions about the stage of your cancer or what it means, ask your doctor to explain it to you in a way you understand.

      "Content": "Survival rates can give you an idea of what percentage of people with the same type and stage of cancer are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they were diagnosed. They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding of how likely it is that your treatment will be successful.

      Keep in mind that survival rates are estimates and are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of people who had a specific cancer, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. These statistics can be confusing and may lead you to have more questions. Your doctor knows your situation, so ask them how these numbers might apply to you.
      
      What is a 5-year relative survival rate?
      A relative survival rate compares people with the same type and stage of cancer to people in the overall population. For example, if the 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of melanoma of the skin is 90%, it means that people who have that cancer are, on average, about 90% as likely as people who don’t have that cancer to live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed.
      
      Where do these numbers come from?
      The American Cancer Society relies on information from the SEER* database, maintained by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), to provide survival statistics for different types of cancer.
      
      The SEER database tracks 5-year relative survival rates for melanoma skin cancer in the United States, based on how far the cancer has spread. The SEER database, however, does not group cancers by AJCC TNM stages (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, etc.). Instead, it groups cancers into localized, regional, and distant stages:
      
      Localized: There is no sign that the cancer has spread beyond the skin where it started.
      Regional: The cancer has spread beyond the skin where it started to nearby structures or lymph nodes.
      Distant: The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, or skin on other parts of the body.

      Understanding the numbers
      These numbers apply only to the stage of the cancer when it is first diagnosed. They do not apply later on if the cancer grows, spreads, or comes back after treatment.
      These numbers don’t take everything into account. Survival rates are grouped based on how far the cancer has spread, but your age, overall health, how well the cancer responds to treatment, and other factors can also affect your outlook. For example, younger people tend to have a better outlook than older people, regardless of the stage. And people who have weakened immune systems, such as those who have had organ transplants or who are infected with HIV, are at greater risk of dying from their melanoma.
      People now being diagnosed with melanoma may have a better outlook than these numbers show. Treatments have improved over time, and these numbers are based on people who were diagnosed and treated at least five years earlier.

      Cancer can start any place in the body. Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts when skin cells called melanocytes grow out of control.
      
      Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body and grow there. When cancer cells do this, it’s called metastasis. To doctors, the cancer cells in the new place look just like the ones that started in the skin.
      
      Cancer is always named based on the place where it starts. So when melanoma skin cancer spreads to any other organ, it’s still called melanoma.

      Ask your doctor to use this picture to show you where your cancer is
      
      What is a melanocyte?
      Melanocytes are cells in the skin. They make a brown pigment called melanin, which makes the skin brown or tan.
      
      Are there different kinds of skin cancer?
      There are many types of skin cancer. Your doctor can tell you more about the type of skin cancer you have.
      
      Basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are much more common than melanoma and don’t often spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is more deadly because it is more likely to spread to other parts of the body.
      
      Questions to ask the doctor
      Why do you think I have cancer?
      Is there a chance I don’t have cancer?
      Would you please write down the kind of cancer you think I might have?
      What will happen next?
      How does the doctor know I have melanoma?
      A new spot on your skin or a spot that’s changing in size, shape, or color may be a warning sign of melanoma. If you have any of these changes, have your skin checked by a doctor.
      
      The doctor will ask you questions about when the spot on your skin first showed up and if it has changed in size or the way it looks. The rest of your skin will be checked. During the exam your doctor will check the size, shape, color and texture of any skin changes. If signs are pointing to melanoma, more tests will be done.
      
      Tests that might be done
      Biopsy: In a biopsy, the doctor takes out a small piece of tissue to check it for cancer cells. A biopsy is the only way to tell for sure if you have skin cancer and what kind it is. There are many types of skin biopsies. Ask your doctor what kind you will need. Each type has pros and cons. The choice of which type to use depends on your own case.
      
      Lab tests of biopsy samples: If melanoma is found, lab tests might be done on the cancer cells to see if they have certain gene changes. This might affect your treatment options.
      
      Chest x-ray: This test may be done to see if the melanoma has spread to your lungs.
      
      Ultrasound: This test uses sound waves and their echoes to make pictures of the inside of your body. Ultrasound might be used to look at lymph nodes (small collections of immune cells) near the tumor to see if the cancer has spread there.
      
      CT or CAT scan: This test uses x-rays to make detailed pictures of your insides. A CT scan may be used to see if nearby lymph nodes are swollen or if organs like the lungs or liver have spots that might be from the spread of melanoma. If any spots are found, a CT scan might be used to guide a needle into the spots to do a biopsy.
      
      MRI scan: This test uses radio waves and strong magnets instead of x-rays to make detailed pictures of your insides. It's very good for looking at the brain and spinal cord. This test can help show if the cancer has spread.
      
      PET scan: PET scans use a special kind of sugar that can be seen inside your body with a special camera. If there’s cancer, this sugar shows up as “hot spots” where the cancer is found. This test can help show if and where the cancer has spread.
      
      Questions to ask the doctor
      What tests will I need?
      Who will do these tests?
      Where will they be done?
      Who can explain them to me?
      How and when will I get the results?
      Who will explain the results to me?
      What do I need to do next?
      How serious is my cancer?
      If you have melanoma, the doctor will want to find out how far it has spread. This is called staging. Your doctor will want to find out the stage of your cancer to help decide what type of treatment is best for you.
      
      The stage describes the growth or spread of the melanoma through the skin. It also tells if it has spread to other parts of your body.
      
      Your cancer can be stage 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, like stage 4, means a more serious cancer that has spread beyond the skin. Be sure to ask the doctor about the cancer stage and what it means for you.
      
      Questions to ask the doctor
      Do you know the stage of the cancer?
      If not, how and when will you find out the stage of the cancer?
      Would you explain to me what the stage means in my case?
      Based on the stage of melanoma, how long do you think I’ll live?
      What will happen next?
      What kind of treatment will I need?
      There are many ways to treat melanoma. The main types of treatment are:
      
      Surgery
      Immunotherapy
      Targeted therapy
      Chemotherapy
      Radiation
      Most early stage melanomas can be treated with surgery alone. More advanced cancers need other treatments.
      
      The treatment plan that’s best for you will depend on:
      
      The stage of the cancer
      The results of lab tests on the cancer cells
      The chance that a type of treatment will cure the melanoma or help in some way
      Your age
      Other health problems you have
      Your feelings about the treatment and the side effects that come with it
      Surgery
      Surgery is the main treatment for most melanomas. It can often cure early-stage melanomas. There are different kinds of surgery. The type that’s best for you depends on how large the melanoma is and where it is. Ask your doctor what kind of surgery you will have and what to expect.
      
      Side effects of surgery
      Any type of surgery can have risks and side effects. Be sure to ask the doctor what you can expect. If you have problems, let your doctors know. Doctors who treat people with melanoma should be able to help you with any problems that come up.
      
      Immunotherapy
      Immunotherapy is treatment that boosts your own immune system to attack the melanoma cells. Many types of immunotherapy are used to treat melanoma. These drugs may be given into a vein, given as a shot, or taken as pills.
      
      Side effects of immunotherapy
      Immunotherapy can cause many different side effects, depending on which drug is used. Some of these drugs might make you feel tired, sick to your stomach, and cause fever, chills, and rashes. Most of these problems go away after treatment ends.
      
      There are ways to treat most of the side effects from immunotherapy. If you have side effects, talk to your cancer care team so they can help.
      
      Targeted therapy
      Targeted therapy drugs may be used for certain types of melanoma. These drugs affect mainly cancer cells and not normal cells in the body. They may work even if other treatment doesn’t. They may cause fewer side effects.
      
      Chemo
      Chemo is the short word for chemotherapy – the use of drugs to fight cancer. The drugs may be given into a vein or taken as pills. These drugs go into the blood and spread through the body. They kill cells that are fast growing cancer cells and good cells like blood cells and hair. Chemo is given in cycles or rounds. Each round of treatment is followed by a break. Most of the time, 2 or more chemo drugs are given. Treatment often lasts for many months.
      
      Side effects of chemo
      Chemo can make you feel very tired, sick to your stomach, and cause your hair to fall out. But these problems go away after treatment ends.
      
      There are ways to treat most chemo side effects. If you have side effects, talk to your cancer care team so they can help.
      
      Radiation treatments
      Radiation uses high-energy rays (like x-rays) to kill cancer cells. Radiation is not usually used to treat the main spot on the skin. But it may be used after surgery to help keep the melanoma from coming back.
      
      Side effects of radiation treatments
      If your doctor suggests radiation treatment, talk about what side effects might happen. Side effects depend on the part of the body that’s treated. The most common side effects of radiation are:
      
      Sunburn-like skin changes where the radiation is given
      Hair loss where the radiation enters the body
      Feeling very tired (fatigue)
      Most side effects get better after treatment ends. Some might last longer. Talk to your cancer care team about what you can expect.
      
      Clinical trials
      Clinical trials are research studies that test new drugs or other treatments in people. They compare standard treatments with others that may be better.
      
      Clinical trials are one way to get the newest cancer treatment. They are the best way for doctors to find better ways to treat cancer. If your doctor can find one that’s studying the kind of cancer you have, it’s up to you whether to take part. And if you do sign up for a clinical trial, you can always stop at any time.
      
      If you would like to learn more about clinical trials that might be right for you, start by asking your doctor if your clinic or hospital conducts clinical trials. See Clinical Trials to learn more.
      
      What about other treatments I hear about?
      When you have cancer you might hear about other ways to treat the cancer or treat your symptoms. These may not always be standard medical treatments. These treatments may be vitamins, herbs, special diets, and other things. You may wonder about these treatments.
      
      Some of these are known to help, but many have not been tested. Some have been shown not to help. A few have even been found to be harmful. Talk to your doctor about anything you’re thinking about using, whether it’s a vitamin, a diet, or anything else.
      
      Questions to ask the doctor
      How far has the melanoma spread under my skin?
      Has it spread anywhere else?
      What treatment do you think is best for me?
      What’s the goal of this treatment? Do you think it could cure the cancer?
      Will treatment include surgery? If so, who will do the surgery?
      What will the surgery be like?
      Will I need other types of treatment, too?
      What’s the goal of these treatments?
      What side effects could I have from these treatments?
      What can I do about side effects that I might have?
      Is there a clinical trial that might be right for me?
      What about special vitamins or diets that friends tell me about? How will I know if they are safe?
      How soon do I need to start treatment?
      What should I do to be ready for treatment?
      Is there anything I can do to help the treatment work better?
      What’s the next step?
      What will happen after treatment?
      You’ll be glad when treatment is over. For years after treatment, you will see your cancer doctor. Be sure to go to all of these follow-up visits. You will have exams, blood tests, and maybe other tests to see if the cancer has come back.
      
      At first, your visits may be every few months. Then, the longer you’re cancer-free, the less often the visits are needed. After 5 years, they may be done once a year.
      
      Having cancer and dealing with treatment can be hard, but it can also be a time to look at your life in new ways. You might be thinking about how to improve your health. Call us at 1-800-227-2345 or talk to your cancer care team to find out what you can do to feel better.
      
      You can’t change the fact that you have cancer. What you can change is how you live the rest of your life – making healthy choices and feeling as good as you can."

      Melanoma 
      MelanomaOpen pop-up dialog box
      Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin — the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can also form in your eyes and, rarely, inside your body, such as in your nose or throat.
      
      The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds increases your risk of developing melanoma. Limiting your exposure to UV radiation can help reduce your risk of melanoma.
      
      The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. Knowing the warning signs of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is detected early.
      
      Symptoms
      Moles 
      MolesOpen pop-up dialog boxMelanoma
      MelanomaOpen pop-up dialog box
      Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face.

      Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin.

      The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:

      A change in an existing mole
      The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin
      Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin.

      Normal moles
      Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser.

      Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age.

      Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma
      To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE:

      A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves.
      B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas.
      C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color.
      D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).
      E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding.
      Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.

      Hidden melanomas
      Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area.

      Hidden melanomas include:

      Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment.
      Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions.
      Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera). An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.
      When to see a doctor
      Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any skin changes that seem unusual."

      Excisional biopsy of the skin
      Excisional biopsyOpen pop-up dialog boxPunch biopsy
      Punch biopsyOpen pop-up dialog box
      Tests and procedures used to diagnose melanoma include:
      
      Physical exam. Your doctor will ask questions about your health history and examine your skin to look for signs that may indicate melanoma.
      Removing a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). To determine whether a suspicious skin lesion is melanoma, your doctor may recommend removing a sample of skin for testing. The sample is sent to a lab for examination.
      
      What type of biopsy procedure your doctor recommends will depend on your particular situation. Most often doctors recommend removing the entire growth when possible. One common technique, the punch biopsy, is done with a circular blade that's pressed into the skin around the suspicious mole. Another technique, called an excisional biopsy, uses a scalpel to cut away the entire mole and a small margin of healthy tissue around it.
      
      Determining the extent of the melanoma
      Related information
      Melanoma spread: How lymph nodes play a role in detection
      If you receive a diagnosis of melanoma, the next step is to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer. To assign a stage to your melanoma, your doctor will:
      
      Determine the thickness. The thickness of a melanoma is determined by carefully examining the melanoma under a microscope and measuring it with a special tool. The thickness of a melanoma helps doctors decide on a treatment plan. In general, the thicker the tumor, the more serious the disease.
      
      Thinner melanomas may only require surgery to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it. If the melanoma is thicker, your doctor may recommend additional tests to see if the cancer has spread before determining your treatment options.
      
      See if the melanoma has spread to the lymph nodes. If there's a risk that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, your doctor may recommend a procedure known as a sentinel node biopsy.
      
      During a sentinel node biopsy, a dye is injected in the area where your melanoma was removed. The dye flows to the nearby lymph nodes. The first lymph nodes to take up the dye are removed and tested for cancer cells. If these first lymph nodes (sentinel lymph nodes) are cancer-free, there's a good chance that the melanoma has not spread beyond the area where it was first discovered.
      
      Look for signs of cancer beyond the skin. For people with more-advanced melanomas, doctors may recommend imaging tests to look for signs that the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. Imaging tests may include X-rays, CT scans and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. These imaging tests generally aren't recommended for smaller melanomas with a lower risk of spreading beyond the skin.
      Other factors may go into determining the risk that the cancer may spread (metastasize), including whether the skin over the area has formed an open sore (ulceration) and how many dividing cancer cells (mitoses) are found when looking under a microscope.
      
      Melanoma is staged using the Roman numerals 0 through IV. At stage 0 and stage I, a melanoma is small and has a very successful treatment rate. But the higher the numeral, the lower the chances of a full recovery. By stage IV, the cancer has spread beyond your skin to other organs, such as your lungs or liver.
      
      Treatment
      The best treatment for your melanoma depends on the size and stage of cancer, your overall health, and your personal preferences.

      Treatment for small melanomas
      Treatment for early-stage melanomas usually includes surgery to remove the melanoma. A very thin melanoma may be removed entirely during the biopsy and require no further treatment. Otherwise, your surgeon will remove the cancer as well as a border of normal skin and a layer of tissue beneath the skin. For people with early-stage melanomas, this may be the only treatment needed.

      Treating melanomas that have spread beyond the skin
      If melanoma has spread beyond the skin, treatment options may include:

      Surgery to remove affected lymph nodes. If melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes, your surgeon may remove the affected nodes. Additional treatments before or after surgery also may be recommended.
      Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a drug treatment that helps your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system might not attack cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.

      Immunotherapy is often recommended after surgery for melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes or to other areas of the body. When melanoma can't be removed completely with surgery, immunotherapy treatments might be injected directly into the melanoma.

      Targeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific weaknesses present within cancer cells. By targeting these weaknesses, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Cells from your melanoma may be tested to see if targeted therapy is likely to be effective against your cancer.

      For melanoma, targeted therapy might be recommended if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes or to other areas of your body.

      Radiation therapy. This treatment uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be directed to the lymph nodes if the melanoma has spread there. Radiation therapy can also be used to treat melanomas that can't be removed completely with surgery.

      For melanoma that spreads to other areas of the body, radiation therapy can help relieve symptoms.

      Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be given intravenously, in pill form or both so that it travels throughout your body.

      Chemotherapy can also be given in a vein in your arm or leg in a procedure called isolated limb perfusion. During this procedure, blood in your arm or leg isn't allowed to travel to other areas of your body for a short time so that the chemotherapy drugs travel directly to the area around the melanoma and don't affect other parts of your body.
          
      Coping and support
      A cancer diagnosis can change your life forever. Each person finds his or her own way of coping with the emotional and physical changes cancer brings. But when you're first diagnosed with cancer, sometimes it's difficult to know what to do next.

      Here are some ideas to help you cope:

      Learn enough about melanoma to make decisions about your care. Ask your doctor about your cancer, including your treatment options and, if you like, your prognosis. As you learn more about cancer, you may become more confident in making treatment decisions.
      Keep friends and family close. Keeping your close relationships strong will help you deal with your cancer. Friends and family can provide the practical support you'll need, such as helping take care of your home if you're in the hospital. And they can serve as emotional support when you feel overwhelmed by cancer.
      Find someone to talk with. Find a good listener who is willing to listen to you talk about your hopes and fears. This may be a friend or family member. The concern and understanding of a counselor, medical social worker, clergy member or cancer support group also may be helpful.

      Ask your doctor about support groups in your area. Other sources of information include the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society.

      Preparing for your appointment
      Start by seeing your family doctor if you notice any skin changes that concern you. Depending on your situation and the outcome of any tests, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in skin diseases (dermatologist) or to a doctor who specializes in cancer treatment (oncologist).

      Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot to discuss, it's a good idea to be well prepared for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready and know what to expect from your doctor.

      What you can do
      Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet.
      Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
      Make a list of all medications, vitamins or supplements you're taking.
      Take a family member or friend along. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
      Write down questions to ask your doctor.
      Your time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important, in case time runs out. For melanoma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:

      Do I have melanoma?
      How large is my melanoma?
      How deep is my melanoma?
      Has my melanoma spread beyond the area of skin where it was first discovered?
      What additional tests do I need?
      What are my treatment options?
      Can any treatment cure my melanoma?
      What are the potential side effects of each treatment option?
      Is there one treatment you feel is best for me?
      How long can I take to decide on a treatment option?
      Should I see a specialist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover it?
      Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?
      What will determine whether I should plan for a follow-up visit?
      In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment."

      "Content": "Rakovina kože nezahŕňa len jeden určitý typ rakovinového bujnenia, ale rozoznávame niekoľko jej typov. Podľa štruktúry a časti kože, na ktorej pozorujeme rast týchto zmenených buniek rozoznávame bazalióm, spinalióm a najnebezpečnejší z nich - melanóm. 
 

      Bazalióm predstavuje najčastejšiu formu kožného nádoru, ktorý vzniká z najvrchnejších buniek našej pokožky - z epidermy a  postihuje najmä staršie osoby. Ide o typ nádoru, ktorý zvyčajne nemetastázuje, teda sa nešíri do ďalších častí tela a lieči sa jeho odstránením.
      
       
      
      Spinalióm vzniká z epitelového tkaniva, zloženého z plochých buniek nachádzajúcich sa v našich orgánoch. Najčastejšie sa vyskytuje na epitelových bunkách našej pokožky, postihuje staršiu populáciu a na rozdiel od bazaliómu má schopnosť rozširovať sa do iných častí tela, preto je jeho liečenie komplikovanejšie1. 
      
       
      
      Malígny melanóm je zhubný nádor vznikajúci z pigmentových buniek, tzv. melanocytov. Hoci je jeho výskyt v porovnaní s hore uvedenými typmi nádorov nižší, je o to nebezpečnejší. Môže sa vyskytovať nielen na našej pokožke, ale aj napríklad na slizniciach a oku. 
      
       
      
      Najčastejšia forma melanómu sa nachádza na pokožke a najrizikovejšie sú práve plochy, ktoré sú najviac vystavované priamemu slnečnému žiareniu a opaľovaniu. Má veľmi dobrú schopnosť šírenia sa do ďalších častí ľudského tela a radí sa medzi 19. najčastejšie onkologické ochorenie na svete a 11. najčastejšie onkologické ochorenie na Slovensku. 
      
       
      
      Jeho výskyt v posledných desaťročiach stúpa a na Slovensku sa jeho výskyt za posledných 30 rokov strojnásobil. Jeho riziko spočíva najmä v jeho vysokej miere úmrtnosti v prípade, že sa objaví až v neskoršom štádiu ochorenia. 
      
       
      
      Príčiny vzniku ochorenia nie sú doposiaľ plne objasnené. Pri vzniku malígneho melanómu zohráva dôležitú rolu genetická predispozícia a vplyv vonkajších faktorov. Medzi najrizikovejšie vonkajšie faktory patrí ultrafialové žiarenie. Predpokladá sa, že až 90% nových melanómov vzniká v dôsledku nadmerného pôsobenia slnečných lúčov na našu pokožku2. 
      
       
      
      Diagnostika 
      
      Ochorenie je najčastejšie diagnostikované v ambulancii dermatológa. Diagnóza sa podľa závažnosti rozdeľuje do piatich štádií, do štádia 0 až 4, ktoré odzrkadľujú závažnosť rozšírenia ochorenia a ďalší postup pri liečbe3.
      
      V ambulancii sa pacienti najčastejšie stretávajú s dermatoskopických vyšetrením znamienok, ktoré až 10 násobne zväčšia postihnuté miesto a vďaka tomu ho dokáže ošetrujúci lekár bližšie popísať - jeho farbu, veľkosť, hrúbku a ďalšie zmeny. Na doplňujúce vyšetrenia sa používa ultrasonografia a histopatologické vyšetrenie, pri ktorom je odobratá malá vzorka tkaniva na jeho bližšiu analýzu2. 
      
       
      
      Liečba ochorenia
      
       
      
      Medzi možnosti liečby malígneho melanómu patrí chirurgické odstránenie poškodenej časti tkaniva, rádioterapia, chemoterapia a cielená imunoterapia a biologická liečba zameraná na konkrétne gény a proteíny. Najefektívnejším nástrojom na boj so stále častejším malígnym melanóm je však prevencia2. 
      
       
      
      Prevencia
      
      Až 90% prípadov výskytu malígneho melanómu je preventabilných. Je preto dôležité nezabudnúť na každoročné preventívne vyšetrenie našej kože, a to buď v dermatologickej ambulancii, alebo počas kampaní verejného zdravia určených pre širokú verejnosť. 
      
       
      
      Počas letných mesiacov a pri každom silnejšom vystavení sa slnečným lúčom preto nezabúdajme na:
      
      nosenie pokrývky hlavy a častí tela, ktoré sú najrýchlejšie spálené, akými sú napríklad ramená a chrbát,
      vyhýbanie sa priamemu slnečnému žiareniu v hodinách od 10:00 do 14:00, 
      používanie ochranných faktorov s minimálnym SPF 30 a s UVA aj UVB ochranou4."

      Melanómy patria medzi najagresívnejšie typy rakoviny - spôsobujú až 90 % úmrtí na kožné nádory. Aj pri boji s nimi pomáha nová biologická liečba.

      Čo je melanóm
      Malígny melanóm je zhubný nádor, ktorý vzniká v dôsledku nekontrolovaného delenia melanocytov. Melanocyty sú bunky nachádzajúce sa v spodnej vrstve kože. Ich prirodzenou funkciou je tvorba kožného pigmentu, melanínu, ktorý má ako „slnečník“ chrániť jadrá buniek pred pôsobením UV žiarenia a tým zabrániť poškodeniu DNA a vzniku porúch pri delení buniek.
      
      Melanóm môže prerásť do okolitého tkaniva alebo sa šíriť do ďalších častí tela – metastázovať. Melanóm vzniká buď z už existujúceho znamienka alebo na predtým neporušenej koži. Melanómy sú v prevažnej väčšine nádory kože. Niekedy môžu vznikať aj v iných častiach tela, napríklad v oku alebo na slizniciach tráviaceho či močovo-pohlavného traktu.
      
       
      
      Melanómy tvoria 2 % všetkých nádorov a patria medzi najagresívnejšie typy rakoviny – spôsobujú až 90 % úmrtí na kožné nádory.
      Podľa typu rastu a správania môžeme melanómy rozdeliť na: 
      typy melanomu
      
      Prečo sa nás melanóm týka
      
      Malígny melanóm patrí medzi typy rakoviny, ktorých výskyt sa v posledných rokoch celosvetovo zvyšuje. Stále častejšie je diagnostikovaný aj u mladých ľudí. Najčastejší výskyt je v Austrálii, čo sa vysvetľuje tenkou ozónovou vrstvou nad týmto kontinentom. V strednej Európe je výskyt 10-14/100 000 obyvateľov. Na Slovensku bol za posledných 35 rokov zaznamenaný 4-násobný nárast. Výskyt celosvetovo rastie o 3 % ročne.

      Kto je ohrozený
      Výskum spája vznik melanómu s vystavením UV žiareniu, fototypom a opaľovacími návykmi.
      
      UV žiarenie – závisí od tzv. kumulatívnej dávky UV žiarenia, teda celkového množstva žiarenia, ktorému je človek počas života vystavený. Tiež od toho, či ide o chronické alebo prerušované pôsobenie, silu žiarenia a počet spálení kože slnkom. Ten je dôležitý najmä v detskom veku, kedy 1-2 spálenia kože zvyšujú riziko vzniku melanómu až päťnásobne (myslí sa vážne spálenie kože, sprevádzané vznikom pľuzgierov). Opakované spálenie kože prispieva ku zvýšeniu rizika vzniku melanómu.
      Fototyp – kožný fototyp popisuje reakciu kože na slnečné žiarenie. Odvíja sa od farby vlasov a kože, rozlišuje sa fototyp 1 až 4. Fototypy 1-2 so svetlou farbou kože, svetlou farbou vlasov a modrými či zelenými očami sú z hľadiska vzniku melanómu rizikovejšie.
      Bolo dokázané, že vznik melanómu priamo súvisí s celkovým počtom znamienok na tele. Riziko vzniku melanómu je asi 1,5x vyššie u ľudí s 11 – 25 znamienkami (v porovnaní s tými, ktorí majú ≤10 znamienok) a zdá sa, že sa až 2x zvyšuje s každými ďalšími 25 znamienkami. Rodinný výskyt melanómu sa udáva v 5 až 10 % prípadov.
      
      Znamienka naznačia, či sa niečo deje
      Prevencia je v prípade malígneho melanómu veľmi dôležitá. Svoju kožu by sme si mali samovyšetrovať rovnako, ako je tomu napríklad pri prsníkoch alebo semenníkoch. Znamená to, že by sme si mali celú kožu (napr. aj za pomoci zrkadla) raz do mesiaca, ale aspoň 3-krát do roka celú poprezerať. Sledovať by sme mali už existujúce znamienka, ale aj to, či nejaké pribudli a ako sa správajú.
      
      Pre rozpoznanie podozrivých znamienok sa používa tzv. pravidlo ABCDE:
      
      A – asymetria
      B (border) – hranica; nepravidelné okraje so zárezni
      C (color) – farba, zmes farieb s rôznymi odtieňmi hnedej, čiernernohnedej až čiernej, červenofialovej, svetlofialovej až strata farby
      D (diameter) – priemer väčší ako 6mm
      E (evolution) – vývoj, teda zmeny na znamienku pozorované v priebehu času. 
      Vyšetrenie „podozrivých“ znamienok špecialistom – dermatológom prebieha s použitím špeciálneho prístroja – dermatoskopu. Dermatoskop je vlastne „lupa“, ktorá umožňuje bližšie vyhodnotenie znamienka. Najčastejšie sa využíva prenosný ručný dermatoskop, ktorý zväčšuje 10-20x. Umožňuje lekárovi pozorovať farebné, štrukturálne a cievne zmeny, ktoré sa môžu vyskytnúť v znamienku.
      
      Aj táto metóda sa vyvíja a v prípade moderných digitálnych dermatoskopov je možné uchovanie obrazu, opakované hodnotenie, sledovanie zmien v čase a ich hodnotenie matematickou analýzou. Skúsený dermatológ je schopný pri vyšetrení odhaliť približne 70 % melanómov, v prípade použitia dermatoskopu až 89 % a správnosť stanovenej diagnózy dosahuje 79 %.
      
      V prípade nejasných či podozrivých nálezov pacientov vyšetria na špecializovaných pracoviskách. Nie každé „podozrivé“ znamienko znamená malígny melanóm. Odlíšiť je potrebné iné pigmentové znamienka (névy), ako sú vrodené névy, atypické névy, hemangiómy, iné kožné nádory.
      
      Definitívna diagnóza melanómu je stanovená až patológom na základe vyšetrenia vzorky znamienka. Každé znamienko, ktoré chirurg vyberie, aj keď iba z kozmetických dôvodov, má byť histologicky vyšetrené patológom, aby sa vylúčila prítomnosť zhubných buniek.
      
      Diagnóza malígny melanóm
      V prípade definitívneho stanovenia diagnózy malígneho melanómu závisí ďalší postup od tzv. klinického štádia, teda miery postihnutia organizmu ochorením.
      
      Je potrebné dôkladne vyšetriť samotný nádor, teda jeho hrúbku, mieru agresivity, mieru postihnutia okolitého tkaniva, prítomnosť či neprítomnosť porušenia povrchu (ulceráciu).
      
      V prípade podozrenia na rozšírenie do ostatných častí tela sa vyšetrujú aj spádové lymfatické uzliny, teda tie, do ktorých je odvádzaná lymfa z príslušnej časti tela, v ktorej sa nachádza melanóm. Existencia vzdialených ložísk – metastáz – je vylúčená alebo potvrdená pomocou zobrazovacích vyšetrení, ako sú USG, RTG, CT, PET CT.
      
      Melanóm liečime už vyše sto rokov
      melanoma_prezivanie
      
      Melanóm je v pokročilých štádiách ochorenia jedným z najagresívnejších typov rakoviny vôbec. Našťastie asi 90 % pacientov s melanómom je diagnostikovaných ešte v čase bez výskytu vzdialených ložísk – metastáz. Ak sú pri diagnóze nájdené aj metastázy, prognóza pacienta sa zhoršuje.
      
      Dĺžka prežívania závisí aj od umiestnenia metastáz: 10-ročné prežívanie 30 až 70 % pacientov sa uvádza pri postihnutí kože v okolí primárneho nádoru; 20 až 40 % pri postihnutí lymfatických uzlín v spádovej oblasti. V prípade vzdialených metastáz bola prognóza pacientov veľmi zlá – 6-9 mesiacov. Aj vďaka novým technológiám a liečebným postupom sa tieto čísla postupne zlepšujú.
      
      Dobrou správou je, že v priebehu posledných rokov došlo k veľkému posunu v liečbe melanómu a v tejto oblasti naďalej prebieha aktívny výskum.
      
      Základným a najstarším spôsobom liečby malígneho melanómu, ktorý sa používa od začiatku dvadsiateho storočia, je chirurgické odstránenie. Lekári sa snažia odstrániť všetky nádorové bunky, aby zabránili ich pretrvávaniu v organizme a ďalšiemu šíreniu do iných častí tela. Chemoterapia sa v liečbe MM začala používať od sedemdesiatych rokov a koncom minulého storočia sa prvýkrát v liečbe pacientov uplatnila nová liečebná metóda, označovaná ako imunoterapia. Tá pomáhala vlastnému imunitnému systému pacienta bojovať s ochorením. V tom čase ale ešte nedokázala výrazne zlepšiť prognózu väčšiny pacientov.
      
      icon_bed
      Chirurgická liečba – cieľom chirurgickej liečby je odstrániť samotný nádor a s ním všetky malígne bunky. Melanóm sa preto odstraňuje s tzv. bezpečnostným lemom, teda spolu s okrajom tvoreným zdravým tkanivom. Šírka tohto okraja závisí od konkrétneho nádoru a jeho lokalizácie. Pre mnohých pacientov, ktorým bol melanóm diagnostikovaný dostatočne zavčasu, je chirurgické odstránenie zákrokom vedúcim k vyliečeniu.
      
      icon_radioactive
      Radiačná terapia – v niektorých prípadoch, napríklad ak nie je možné odstrániť primárny nádor chirurgicky, môže byť základnou liečebnou metódou. Častejšie sa však využíva ako doplnková liečba po chirurgickom zákroku, ak nebolo možné odstrániť všetky nádorové bunky. Jej cieľom je tieto bunky usmrtiť a zabrániť (alebo aspoň oddialiť) napredovaniu ochorenia. Rádioterapia je podobná röntgenu, ale žiarenie je silnejšie. Postihnuté miesto je ožarované zvonku, zvyčajne vo viacerých malých dávkach. Krátkodobo môže viesť k podráždeniu kože v ožarovanej lokalite, opuchu alebo únave.
      
      icon_pills
      Chemoterapia – je metóda, ktorá zabíja nádorové bunky. Jej nevýhodou je, že pôsobí nešpecificky, teda nie len na rakovinové bunky, ale aj na všetky ostatné zdravé bunky v tele. To, čo robí nádory zhubnými je schopnosť ich buniek rýchlo sa množiť a dlhodobo prežívať. Chemoterapia ovplyvňuje na rôznych stupňoch práve delenie buniek. Sú na ňu preto najcitlivejšie rýchlo sa deliace nádorové bunky, ale aj iné typy rýchlo sa deliacich zdravých buniek. Ide napríklad o bunky vlasových folikulov či črevnej sliznice. S tým súvisia aj nežiaduce účinky chemoterapie.
      
      V mnohých diagnózach sa ako najúčinnejšie ukázali kombinácie rôznych chemoterapeutických metód. V liečbe melanómu to však úplne neplatí, často sa liečba začína iba jedným liekom a kombinované režimy sa používajú až v ďalších fázach liečby.
      
      Adjuvantná liečba – tiež nazývaná aj „zaisťovacia“. Je určená pre pacientov s väčším rozsahom ochorenia, ktorým sa však podarilo celý nádor chirurgicky odstrániť. Jej cieľom je zahubiť rakovinové bunky, ktoré by napriek vyrezaniu melanómu mohli stále kolovať v tele.
      
      Paliatívna liečba – ide o liečbu v štádiu metastatického ochorenia. Jej cieľom je predĺžiť prežívanie pacientov, oddialiť a zmierniť príznaky ochorenia.
      
      Biologická liečba melanómu
      Vďaka výskumu dnes existujú lieky na melanóm aj zo skupiny biologickej liečby. Rovnako ako chemoterapia zabraňuje rastu a deleniu nádorových buniek, robí to však „múdrejším“ spôsobom. Biologická liečba vie napríklad špecificky vyhľadávať a ničiť choré bunky bez ovplyvnenia zdravých buniek alebo podporuje vlastný imunitný systém pacienta, aby nádorové bunky rozpoznal a bojoval proti nim.
      
      kinaza
      
      Jedným typom biologickej liečby, ktorá bola vyvinutá pre pacientov s melanómom, sú BRAF inhibítory.   
      
      Asi u 50 % pacientov je v bunkách melanómu prítomná BRAF mutácia. Znamená to, že genetická informácia uložená v DNA nádorových buniek je poškodená a táto zmena ovplyvňuje prirodzenú schopnosť buniek kontrolovať svoj životný cyklus. Bunky preto nekontrolovateľne rastú a množia sa. BRAF inhibítory pôsobia špecificky na bunky s touto mutáciou, čím zabraňujú ich ďalšiemu rastu. Prvý BRAF inhibitor bol oficiálne schválený Európskou liekovou agentúrou v roku 2012.
      
      Ďalším typom liečby sú MEK inhibítory. Tiež sa používajú u pacientov s mutáciou génu BRAF. Zabraňujú aktivácii bunkových mechanizmov spustených BRAF mutáciou na ďalšej úrovni signálnej dráhy. Prvý MEK inhibitor bol Európskou liekovou agentúrou schválený na použitie v roku 2014.
      
      Inhibítory kontrolných bodov imunitných dráh – za normálnych okolností dokáže imunitný systém rozpoznať nielen cudzorodé látky, ale aj vlastné bunky, ktoré sú nejakým spôsobom poškodené. Nádorové bunky sa dokážu pred bunkami imunitného systému skryť a tvária sa ako zdravé bunky. Inhibítory kontrolných bodov imunitných dráh sú lieky, ktoré „opätovne“ naučia imunitný systém choré bunky rozpoznávať. Výsledkom je, že telo pacienta je schopné bojovať s rakovinou vlastnými silami. Tento typ liečby sa zatiaľ len skúma a pre pacientov v Európskej únii zatiaľ nie je dostupný."

      "Content": "Melanóm je nádor, ktorý vznikol transformáciou melanocytu, bunky produkujúcej pigment. Napriek tomu, že tvorí iba 4 % kožných nádorov, spôsobuje 79 % úmrtí na nádory kože (1).

      EPIDEMIOLÓGIA
      Melanóm patrí k nádorom s výrazne stúpajúcim počtom. Incidencia v posledných 30 rokoch vzrastá každoročne o 3 %. V súčasnosti varíruje od 0,2/100 000 žien v Indii do 42/100 000 v Severnom Queenslande v Austrálii (2, 3). V mužskej populácii sa incidencia pohybuje od 0,5 do 49 na 100 000 obyvateľov. V Českej republike bola v roku 2002 incidencia u mužov 10,5/100 000 obyvateľov a u žien 9,6/100 000 obyvateľov (1). V dôsledku včasného záchytu melanómu stúpa mortalita významne pomalšie než incidencia (Obrázok č. 1). Súvisí to pravdepodobne so stúpajúcim záchytom melanómov vo včasných štádiách. Okrem už spomínaných geografických rozdielov ovplyvňujú epidemiológiu aj pohlavie, vek (vrcholy výskytu medzi 30. – 40. a 55. – 70. rokom) a rasové rozdiely (5).
      
      
      ETIOPATOGENÉZA
      Transformáciu melanocytu na melanóm možno rozdeliť na niekoľko etáp. V prvej dochádza k aberantnému rastu a množeniu névocytov, ktoré vytvárajú hniezda s rôznym stupňom dysplázie. Ďalším stupňom je malígna transformácia buniek na atypické melanocyty. Nádor sa v tejto fáze šíri radiálne v epiderme a môže dosahovať k dermoepidermálnemu rozhraniu (tzv. radiálna rastová fáza). Postupne nádor invaduje do hĺbky dermy (vertikálna rastová fáza). Posledným štádiom je invázia nádorových buniek do lymfatických alebo krvných ciev (Obrázok č. 2) (6).
      
      
      Vznik melanómu je dôsledkom environmentálne indukovaného narušenia bunkových genetických kontrolných mechanizmov. Chromozómové aberácie na chromozómoch 1, 6, 7, 9, 10 a 11 sa opisujú pri sporadických aj familiárnych melanómoch. Geneticky podmienený je fototyp a prirodzená ochrana kože proti UV žiareniu (7). Boli identifikované 2 podozrivé gény, ktoré ovplyvňujú reguláciu cyklín dependentných kináz (CDKN2A) na chromozóme 9p21, sprostredkovane kódujúcom proteín p53 a CDK4 na chromozóme 12q14 (8). Mutácia CDKN2A sa pravdepodobne uplatňuje pri familiárnych a viacpočetných melanómoch. Významným je i fakt, že väčšina melanómových bunkových línií obsahuje mutácie BRAF génu (70 %), ktorý je kľúčovou súčasťou RAS cesty, ktorá zasahuje do odpovedí buniek na expozíciu UV žiarením. RAF kináza je známa aj ako inhibítor apoptózy. Predmetom výskumu sú v posledných rokoch mutácie onkogénov ako BCL-2, BRAF, NRAS a iných. Ich význam spočíva aj v tom, že slúžia ako terapeutické ciele. Z environmentálnych faktorov má dominantnú úlohu UV žiarenie, zvlášť v pásmach UVB (260 – 320 nm) a UVA (320 – 400 nm). Napriek tomu, že presný mechanizmus kancerogenézy indukovanej UV žiarením nie je známy, výskum v posledných rokoch priniesol výrazný vedomostný posun v tejto oblasti.
      
      
      Patogeneticky sa uplatňuje najmä:
      •    genotoxické poškodenie,
      •    mitogénny efekt,
      •    a strata imunologického dohľadu (9).
      
      Transformácia pigmentového névu na melanóm je teda dôsledkom súhry genetických faktorov, expozície UV žiarenia a zmien v mikroprostredí. Molekulovo-biologické metódy výskumu ukazujú, že práve mikroprostredie zohráva významnú úlohu v procese malígnej transformácie melanocytu. Boli opísané zmeny expresie adhéznych molekúl, ako kadheríny a beta-integríny, ktoré uľahčujú inváziu nádorových buniek. Na transformácii a invázii sa zúčastňuje aj hyperexpresia rastových faktorov a cytokínov (bFGF – bázický rastový faktor pre fibroblasty, HGF – rastový faktor pre hepatocyty, PDGF – rastový faktor derivovaný trombocytmi, interleukín-8 a iné) (6, 10, 11).
      
      RIZIKOVÉ FAKTORY
      1. Expozícia slnka. Mnoho štúdií potvrdilo vzťah medzi expozíciou slnka a melanómom. Uvádza sa, že až dve tretiny melanómov môžu mať vzťah k expozícii slnka. Zdá sa, že rizikovými skupinami sú osoby s tendenciou k spáleniu kože (fototyp I) a opakovanými epizodickými spáleniami kože do veku 18 rokov (7, 12).
      
      2. Významným faktorom vzniku melanómu je aj počet a veľkosť névov. Počet névov je geneticky determinovaný, ale môže byť modifikovaný expozíciou slnka v detstve. Mansfield uvádza, že prítomnosť piatich névov s priemerom väčším než 6 mm zvyšuje riziko melanómu trojnásobne. Riziko sa naviac zvyšuje s počtom atypických névov (13). Podľa Tuckera zvyšuje prítomnosť jedného dysplastického névu riziko melanómu 2,3-násobne, kým prítomnosť viac než piatich lézií až vyše desaťnásobne. Rizikovým faktorom sú tiež kongenitálne obrovské névy (nad 20 centimetrov) (14).
      
      3. Výskyt melanómu v rodinnej a osobnej anamnéze pacienta. Približne 10 % pacientov má výskyt melanómu u blízkeho príbuzného. Familiárny výskyt melanómu môže byť geneticky determinovaný (napríklad mutácie nádorového supresorového génu CDKN2A). Vzhľadom na anamnestické riziká sa odporúča vyšetrenie príbuzných pacientov s melanómom. Prítomnosť melanómu v osobnej anamnéze je indikáciou na dôslednú dispenzarizáciu ďalších pigmentových lézií.
      
      4. Iné rizikové faktory. Xeroderma pigmentosum je významným, ale – našťastie – veľmi zriedkavým faktorom. Ostatné faktory predstavujú relatívne riziko. Patria sem tehotnosť, vyšší vek, dlhodobá PUVA terapia (viac než 250 aplikácií) a niektoré fenotypové faktory, napríklad fototyp I (15).
      
      DIAGNOSTIKA
      Diagnostiku melanómu rozdeľujeme na prebioptickú a bioptickú. Do prebioptickej patria klinické vyšetrenia, dermatoskopické vyšetrenia, sonografia kože a iné neinvazívne zobrazovacie metódy (konfokálna mikroskopia, optická koherentná tomografia). Do bioptickej diagnostiky zaraďujeme dermatohistopatologické vyšetrenie a vyšetrenie sentinelovej lymfatickej uzliny (16).
      
      A. PREBIOPTICKÁ DIAGNOSTIKA
      KLINICKÁ DIAGNOSTIKA
      Diagnostika melanómu v typických prípadoch nerobí problémy. V netypických prípadoch však nezriedka býva zdrojom diagnostických omylov. Urbanček et al. analyzovali výskyt diagnostických omylov melanómu na súbore 936 pacientov. Nesprávna diagnostika bola zachytená v 16 % (17).
      
      Učebnice rozdeľujú štyri základné morfologické typy melanómu (17):
      •    povrchovo sa šíriaci (60 – 70 %),
      •    nodulárny (15 – 30 %),
      •    lentigo maligna melanóm (4 – 10 %),
      •    akrolentiginózny (2 – 8 %, s vyšším podielom u aziatov a černochov),
      •    iné, neklasifikovateľné.
      
      
      Toto klinicko-morfologické rozdelenie pochádza z dôb pred zavedením histopatologickej diagnostiky a jeho význam je iba opisný, bez významnejšej implikácie pre ďalšiu diagnostickú či liečebnú stratégiu. Príklady jednotlivých typov melanómov uvádzame na Obrázku č. 3. Jeden melanóm môže mať súčasne viacero morfologických charakteristík.
      Z atypických foriem robí najväčšie problémy amelanotický melanóm. Diagnostické ťažkosti môžu spôsobiť aj atypické lokalizácie, napríklad v kapilíciu a na slizniciach. Príklady atypických melanómov sú zobrazené na Obrázku č. 4.
      
      DERMATOSKOPIA
      Dermatoskopia (syn. epiluminiscenčná mikroskopia, povrchová svetelná mikroskopia) je od 90. rokov široko používanou neinvazívnou in vivo metódou a dnes sa považuje za rutinné vyšetrenie (20).
      
      Princíp dermatoskopie je analogický, ako u otoskopie, tak aj u endoskopických metód. Dermatoskop je lupa, ktorá vďaka osvetleniu a 10 – 20-násobnému zväčšeniu zobrazuje štruktúry, ktoré nie sú viditeľné voľným okom. Zvýraznenie zmien v hlbších vrstvách epidermis, dermoepidermálnej junkcii a papilárnej dermis uľahčuje použitie imerzie (19). Dermatoskopy používajú – v závislosti od typu prístroja – polarizované aj nepolarizované svetlo. Kým nepolarizované svetlo zobrazuje lepšie povrchové štruktúry, polarizované svetlo nezobrazuje horných 0,06 – 0,1 mm kože a používa sa na detekciu hlbšie uložených štruktúr, akými sú kolagénové zväzky alebo cievy.
      
      Dermatoskopia zvyšuje diagnostickú senzitivitu melanómov o 10 – 27 % a významne znižuje počet zbytočne excidovaných benígnych lézií (21, 22, 23). Vo Vestergaardovej štúdii bola diagnostická presnosť záchytnosti melanómu dermatoskopom 90 %, voľným okom iba 74 % (21).
      
      Dermatoskopická diagnostika v sebe zahŕňa tri aspekty: kognitívny aspekt predstavujúci hodnotenie celkových vlastností lézie, komparatívny aspekt predstavujúci evolúciu lézie (tzv. fenomén škaredého káčatka) a interaktívny, umožňujúci porovnanie nedávnych zmien (24).  Dermatoskopická diagnostika má dva základné kroky. Prvým krokom je diferenciácia pigmentovej a nepigmentovej lézie. Chen uvádza 85-percentnú senzitivitu a 94-percentnú špecificitu prvého kroku (25).
      
      Druhým krokom je posúdenie benígneho či malígneho charakteru pigmentovej lézie (Obrázok č. 5).
      
      
      
      
      Špecifickými štruktúrami pre pigmentové lézie sú:
      •  pigmentová sieť, zodpovedajúca uloženiu melanínu v bazálnych častiach epidermálnych výbežkov,
      •  globuly/dlaždice zodpovedajúce dermálnym papilám obsahujúcimi hniezda melanocytov – névocytov,
      •  radiálne pruhy typické pre Reedov névus,
      •  bezštruktúrne namodralé okrsky, vyskytujúce sa najmä pri modrom néve.
      Príklady dermatoskopických obrazov sú uvedené na Obrázkoch č. 6 a 7.
      
      Najjednoduchšie a v praxi najpoužívanejšie hodnotenie dermatoskopického nálezu sa robí na základe pravidiel ABCD (asymetry, border, color, diameter), ktoré sa kvantifikujú a násobia príslušným koeficientom. Výsledok je súčtom jednotlivých položiek a označuje sa ako celkové dermatoskopické skóre – TDS (26). Keďže sú skórovacie systémy v bežnej praxi časovo náročné a použiteľné iba obmedzene, diagnostika sa stanovuje na základe morfologickej analýzy lézie, tzv. pattern analysis. To okrem dobrých znalostí dermatoskopickej morfológie vyžaduje aj, samozrejme, veľkú skúsenosť. Zatiaľ čo u trénovaných dermatológov zvyšuje dermatoskopia diagnostickú presnosť detekcie melanómu bez významnejšieho predĺženia doby vyšetrenia, u netrénovaných lekárov môže správnu diagnostiku naopak redukovať (28). Dobrou a časovo nenáročnou metódou vhodnou na skríning aj kontrolné vyšetrenia u pacientov s veľkým počtom névov je celotelová fotografia, ktorá sa na Slovensku nevykonáva (27).
      
      SONOGRAFIA KOŽE
      
      Princípom sonografie je získanie obrazu vďaka rozdielnym akustickým vlastnostiam tkanív. Na sonografiu kože sa používa prístroj so špeciálnou sondou 20 až 50 MHz, ktorá je schopná zobraziť epidermis a retikulárnu dermis. V Európe sa používa jediný prístroj, Dermascan C od dánskej firmy Cortex. Melanocytové lézie sa zobrazujú ako hypoechogénne ložiská. Dominantným prínosom sonografie je presné zmeranie hrúbky a objemu melanómu a jeho vaskularizácie (30). Má to praktický význam ako indikátor rozsahu excízie, ktorá je priamo úmerná hrúbke nádoru. Minariková potvrdila veľmi dobrú koreláciu medzi hrúbkou nádoru odmeranou sonograficky a reálnou hrúbkou potvrdenou histologicky (32). Príklad sonografického nálezu je znázornený na Obrázku č. 8.
      INÉ VYŠETROVACIE METÓDY
      Reflexná konfokálna mikroskopia (RCM). Ide o vyšetrenie epidermy a papilárnej dermy in vivo s výsledkom približujúcim sa histologickému obrazu. Nízkoenergetický laser sa aplikuje bodovo a deteguje svetelný bodový odraz cez dierkovaný filter. Robia sa série horizontálnych rezov hrubé 2 – 5 µm, maximálne do 200 – 300 µm, t. j. do papilárnej dermis. RCM s použitím optického vlákna využíva buď odrazový spôsob na základe rozdielneho odrazu štruktúr melanozómov a melanínu, alebo fluorescenčný spôsob, pri ktorom je rozdielna distribúcia špecifických protilátok značkovaných fluoresceínom. Melanín a melanocyty sú vhodnými cieľovými štruktúrami na detekciu konfokálnym mikroskopom. RCM sa využíva ako doplnková, druholíniová diagnostická metóda k dermatoskopickému vyšetreniu (29). V súčasnosti sú už vypracované algoritmy na diagnostiku melanómu pomocou RCT. Napriek tomu, že ide o sľubnú metódu, nevýhodou je vysoká cena prístroja a potreba dlhodobého tréningu vyšetrujúceho. Vyšetrovacia metóda je viazaná na niekoľko európskych centier. Metaanalýza uvedenej vyšetrovacej metódy udáva senzitivitu 93 % a špecificitu 76 % (30).
      
      Optická koherentná tomografia a magnetická rezonancia kože sú v súčasnosti skôr experimentálnymi metódami, ktoré sú viazané na vysokošpecializované pracoviská. Nepredpokladá sa ich výraznejšia penetrácia do rutinnej praxe.
      
      B. BIOPTICKÁ DIAGNOSTIKA
      Histopatologická diagnostika melanómu je základným predpokladom optimálnej liečby. Vyžaduje úzku spoluprácu klinika a patológa. Hodnotenie nálezu skúseným dermatohistopatológom, erudovaným v uvedenej oblasti a rešpektujúcim aktuálne poznatky, prináša klinikovi najcennejšie diagnostické informácie.
      
      Histopatologický záver by mal obsahovať nasledujúce parametre:
      1. histologický podtyp nádoru,
      2. hrúbka nádoru v milimetroch (Breslow) – najdôležitejší prognostický znak,
      3. hĺbka invázie podľa Clarka (Tabuľka č. 1) – okrem niektorých špeciálnych prípadov stanovenie nemá význam,
      4. prítomnosť/neprítomnosť ulcerácie,
      5. horizontálna/vertikálna fáza rastu,
      6. intenzita lymfocytárneho infiltrátu,
      7. mitotický index (počet mitóz na mm2),
      8. prítomnosť lymfatického/cievneho šírenia +- perineurálne šírenie,
      9. prítomnosť/neprítomnosť regresie,
      10. prítomnosť zvyškov névových štruktúr.
      
      Príklady histopatologického obrazu melanómu sú na Obrázkoch č. 9 a 10.
      
      
      
      
      V prípadoch, keď pri základnom farbení hematoxylínom–eozínom nie je možné stanoviť diagnózu (napr. amelanotický, dezmoplastický melanóm, malobunkové nádory), je indikované imunohistochemické vyšetrenie. Najčastejšie používané imunohistochemické markery sú proteín S-100 a monoklonálne protilátky proti HMB-45, Melan A/Mart-1 a Ki-67. Každé z imunohistochemických farbení má špecifický diagnostický význam. V ostatných rokoch sa vyvíjajú molekulovo-genetické invazívne a neinvazívne metodiky zvyšujúce diagnostickú presnosť. Experimentálne bol vyvinutý náplasťový neinvazívny test detegujúci mRNA dvoch melanóm špecifických génov, budúcnosť ukáže jeho potenciálne využitie v praxi (31).
      
      V súvislosti so vstupom nových cielených terapií nadobúda čoraz väčší význam molekulová typizácia melanómu. Medzi najčastejšie patrí vyšetrenie mutácií onkogénov, respektíve protoonkogénov BRAF, obmedzene aj MEK, PD1-ligandu a c-kit v primárnych tumoroch aj v metastatických ložiskách.
      
      Vyšetrenie sentinelovej lymfatickej uzliny bolo zavedené začiatkom 90. rokov ako minimálne invazívna metóda a dnes patrí k štandardným diagnostickým postupom (34). Ide o vyšetrenie „subklinickej“, klinickým vyšetrením nedetegovateľnej mikrometastázy v regionálnej lymfatickej uzline. V súčasnosti sa vykonáva dvojkroková metóda. V prvej fáze sa aplikuje značkované technécium Tc99 perilezionálne v oblasti melanómu, ktoré sa deponuje v uzline. Peroperačne sa uzlina deteguje gamakamerou a označí sa koloidným roztokom metylénovej modrej. Exstirpovaná uzlina sa následne vyšetrí štandardne histologicky a imunohistochemicky, prípadne senzitívnejšími metódami, napríklad reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Potreba vyšetrenia sentinelovej lymfatickej uzliny bola dlhodobo predmetom diskusií v rámci odborných kruhov. V súčasnosti je vyšetrenie sentinelovej uzliny inkorporované do AJCC klasifikácie a považuje sa za štandard (33). Odporcovia tejto vyšetrovacej metódy argumentovali nevýznamnými rozdielmi v celkovom prežívaní, či rizikom iatrogénneho poškodenia. Johnson uvádza nižší výskyt metastáz po včasnej exstirpácii pozitívnej sentinelovej uzliny a následnej kompletnej disekcii lymfatických uzlín – voči skupine, ktorá bola iba sledovaná – a uvádza aj vyššie celkové prežívanie (34). Vyšetrenie sentinelovej uzliny nezvyšuje riziko intranzitných metastáz. Viaceré práce potvrdili, že vyšetrenie sentinelovej uzliny je významný prognostický faktor intervalu bez recidívy aj celkového prežívania, od ktorého sa odvíja ďalšia liečebná stratégia (35). Porovnanie celkového prežívania na základe hrúbky nádoru (Breslow) a vyšetrenia sentinelovej uzliny je uvedené v Tabuľke č. 2.
      
      
      ZÁVER
      Diagnostika melanómu sa v priebehu ostatných rokov posunula na vyššiu úroveň. Vo vzťahu k cieleným terapiám a imunoterapiám sa hovorí o tzv. teragnostics, terapii previazanej s diagnostikou. Diagnostické omyly však aj napriek zavedeniu moderných inštrumentálnych vyšetrovacích metód nie sú zriedkavosťou. V zahraničí je trend hodnotiť presnosť diagnostiky špecializovaných pracovísk pomocou rôznych štatistických nástrojov, napríklad melanómového diagnostického indexu.  Z toho vyplýva potreba intenzívnejšej a systematickej edukácie dermatológov, chirurgov a praktických lekárov."

      Charakteristika
      V súčasnej dobe venujeme veľkú pozornosť nášmu výzoru. Dbáme na to aký máme účes, ako máme upravené obočie, vlasy a nechty. Ale veľmi dôležitá je starostlivosť o našu kožu.
      Starostlivosť o pokožku nie je len o hygiene, pravidelnej hydratácii alebo skrášľovacích procedúrach.
      
      Mnohé ženy, ale čoraz častejšie aj muži, si nájdu čas na manikúru, pedikúru alebo úpravu obočia. Ale kto z nás si nájde čas na preventívnu prehliadku u kožného lekára?
      
      V nasledujúcej časti sa pozrieme na krátku štatistiku, ktorá nás upozorní na závažnosť tejto problematiky.
      
      Od roku 2004 sa Slovensko každoročne zapája do európskeho projektu EUROMELANOMA DAY. Európsky deň melanómu sa koná vždy v máji. V určenom období sa vykonáva vyhľadávanie (skríning) a preventívne vyšetrenia materských znamienok.
      
      V minulosti bol melanóm považovaný za vzácny typ malígneho nádoru. Avšak za posledných 50 rokov jeho výskyt stúpol rýchlejšie ako u ostatných nádorových ochorení.
      
      Napríklad, v roku 1970 bolo v prepočte na 100 000 obyvateľov hlásených v priemere 3,2 nových prípadov u mužov a 3,3 u žien. V roku 1990 sa tento počet zvýšil na 8,1 nových prípadov u mužov a 7,8 u žien. V súčasnosti stúpajúci trend pokračuje. Počet hlásených prípadov sa pohybuje okolo 15,0 na 100 000 obyvateľov.
      
      Melanóm je definovaný ako zhubný nádor kože, ktorý vzniká malígnou premenou melanocytov. Zákernosť tohto ochorenia spočíva v tom, že môže rýchlo metastázovať do pľúc, mozgu a srdca.
      
      Keď nám niekto spomenie melanóm, tak si myslíme, že je to ochorenie kože. Ale pozor, môže vzniknúť aj na slizniciach (ústa, genitálie). U žien sa častejšie vyskytuje na tvári a na nohách. U mužov v hornej časti trupu.
      
      Malígny melanóm sa vyskytuje predovšetkým u bielej rasy. Postihuje najmä ľudí v strednom veku. Ale čoraz častejšie sa objavuje aj u mladších vekových kategórií.
      
      Výskyt melanómu u mužov a žien závisí od veku. Napríklad, u žien mladších ako 40 rokov sa melanóm objavuje častejšie ako u mužov. Starší muži (nad 65 rokov) trpia týmto ochorením dvakrát častejšie ako ženy.
      
      Výskyt malígneho melanómu v posledných rokoch stúpa najmä v Austrálii, v Severnej Amerike, severnej Európe a na Novom Zélande.
      
      Ako vzniká malígny melanóm?
      Malígny melanóm vzniká malígnou premenou melanocytov. Melanocyty sú bunky bazálnej vrstvy epidermy, ktoré tvoria pigment melanín. Normálne melanocyty si môžeme predstaviť ako putujúce bunky.
      
      V priebehu ontogenézy (vývin jedinca) putujú na miesta, kde je tvorený melanín. Nemajú žiadne medzibunkové kontaktné štruktúry. Po mitotickom delení majú sklon k oddeľovaniu sa.
      
      Základnou podmienkou vzniku malígneho melanómu sú melanocyty. Vznik ochorenia nezávisí od melanogenézy (proces syntézy melanínu). Toto zistenie dokazuje rozvoj ochorenia u albínov.
      
      Medzinárodná klasifikácia chorôb (MKCH-10) - C43 - Malígny melanóm kože, Melanoma malignum cutis.
      
      Príčiny
      Príčiny ochorenia nie sú známe. U viac ako 50 % pacientov sa malígny melanóm vyvinie na klinicky normálnej koži. Bohužiaľ, takýto pacienti vyhľadajú lekára až keď sa objavia subjektívne prejavy.
      Medzi subjektívne symptómy malígneho vývoja patria:
      
      zväčšovanie
      mokvanie
      krvácanie
      svrbenie
      U ďalších 5 % pacientov sa vyvinie malígny melanóm na podklade lentigo maligna. To znamená, že vznikol v miestach, ktoré boli vystavené UV žiareniu.
      
      Približne 30 % pacientov uvádza, že sa u nich vyvinul malígny melanóm z už existujúceho materského znamienka.
      
      Existuje niekoľko faktorov, ktoré významne ovplyvňujú výskyt a klinickú charakteristiku ochorenia. Medzi takéto faktory zaraďujeme:
      
      dedičné vplyvy
      zvýšenú expozíciu UV žiareniu
      časté opaľovanie sa v soláriách
      fenotypové vlastnosti (farba pleti a vlasov)
      Približne 10 % všetkých melanómov je familiárnych. Je zaujímavé, že znížená odolnosť kože voči škodlivým vplyvom môže byť podmienená geneticky.
      
      Dôležitú úlohu zohráva mutácia jednotlivých chromozómov a neschopnosť opráv chromozomálnych zmien.
      
      TIP na článok:
      Krásne opálená pokožka a naše zdravie: Ako na zdravé opaľovanie?
      
      Vznik rakoviny kože máme spojený s nadmerným opaľovaním. Je známe, že jedným z najrizikovejších faktorov vzniku melanómu je spálenie kože v detstve.
      
      Odhaduje sa, že deti, ktoré sa do veku 12 rokov viackrát spálili na slnku, majú 3,6x vyššie riziko vzniku melanómu.
      
      V nasledujúcej časti si stručne opíšeme pozitívne a negatívne účinky slnečného žiarenia. Slnečné žiarenie vo veľkej miere ovplyvňuje životné prostredie. Skladá sa z viditeľného (50 %), infračerveného (45 %) a ultrafialového (5 %) žiarenia.
      
      Ultrafialová časť slnečného spektra (UV) je veľmi dôležitá pre mnohé procesy v prírode. Delí sa na:
      
      UVA žiarenie – zapríčiňuje starnutie kože
      UVB žiarenie – spôsobuje opálenie a spálenie kože
      UVC žiarenie - na zemský povrch sa prakticky nedostane, pretože je odfiltrované atmosférou
      Aké sú účinky ultrafialového žiarenia na náš organizmus?
      
      V malých dávkach je potrebné na premenu vitamínu D v koži. Avšak väčšie množstvo UV žiarenia vyvoláva rôzne zmeny na koži:
      
      akútne – začervenanie, zápal, prehriatie
      subakútne – fotodermatózy
      chronické – fotostarnutie, kancerogenéza
      TIP na článok: 
      Vitamín D a jeho účinky. Naše zdravie, pevné kosti či silná imunita?
      
      Najzávažnejším škodlivým účinkom UV žiarenia je riziko kancerogenézy. UV žiarenie spomaľuje delenie buniek, vyvoláva inaktiváciu vnútrobunkových enzýmov a navodzuje vznik mutácií.
      
      UV žiarenie je považované za najdôležitejší vyvolávajúci faktor melanómovej a nemelanómovej rakoviny kože. Pri ich vzniku zohrávajú dôležitú úlohu takzvané osobné faktory:
      
      typ kože
      hydratácia kože
      typ a dávka UV žiarenia
      vek
      spôsob expozície
      anatomická lokalita
      Z vonkajších faktorov sa na vzniku ochorení významne podieľa nadmorská výška, zemepisná šírka, odraz žiarenia, vietor, vlhkosť a teplota vzduchu.
      
      Príkladom typického pacienta s melanómom je zamestnanec pracujúci v administratívnych priestoroch, ktorý nie je pravidelne vystavený UV žiareniu. Pravidelne chodí na dovolenky k moru. Taktiež si dopraje oddych pri mori aj v zime.
      
      Za jeden z rizikových faktorov je považovaná opakovaná a neodborná aplikácia umelých zdrojov UV žiarenia (solária so zdrojom UVA, aplikácia UVA v rámci fototerapie).
      
      Používanie solárií je veľmi populárne. V modernej dobe chcú byť všetci krásne opálení počas celého roka. Ale okrem krásne opálenej pokožky si zo solárií odnášame aj niekoľko nežiaducich účinkov:
      
      spálenie kože
      vznik fototoxických liekových reakcií
      polymorfné svetelné erupcie
      exacerbácia (nové, opätovné prepuknutie choroby) porfýrie
      vyvolanie malígneho melanómu
      Ľudia, ktorí sa pravidelne opaľujú v soláriách majú 3x vyššiu pravdepodobnosť vzniku melanómu ako ľudia, ktorí nikdy neboli v soláriu.
      
      Príklad rizikovej pacientky, ktorá má blond vlasy a veľa znamienok vystavených slnečnému žiareniu.

      Z rizikových faktorov má veľký význam fenotyp človeka. Za najrizikovejších pacientov sa považujú ľudia, ktorí majú:
      
      svetlý fototyp kože (fototyp I a II)
      svetlú farbu vlasov (blond, ryšavé)

      Príznaky
      V súčasnosti rozlišujeme tieto formy malígneho melanómu:
      Lentigo maligna melanóm (LLM)
      Lentigo maligna melanóm predstavuje približne 5 až 15 % prípadov. Vyskytuje sa u starších ľudí (60 – 70 rokov). Vo väčšine prípadov je lokalizovaný na hlave, šiji a na slnku vystavených častiach končatín.
      
      Pre tento typ ochorenia je typický pomalý rast (5 - 20 rokov). Prejavuje sa ako nepravidelne pigmentovaná a neostro ohraničená škvrna. Malígna premena je charakterizovaná vznikom tmavohnedých až čiernych nepravidelných pigmentácií.
      
      Prognóza je pomerne priaznivá.
      
      Superficiálne sa šíriaci melanóm (SSM) – povrchovo sa šíriaci melanóm
      Povrchovo sa šíriaci melanóm je považovaný za najčastejší typ melanómu. Predstavuje 60 až 70 % všetkých diagnostikovaných melanómov kože. Vo väčšine prípadov je diagnostikovaný medzi 40. až 50. rokom života.
      
      U oboch pohlaví sa vyskytuje najmä na chrbte. U žien sa objavuje na nohách. 
      
      Na začiatku sa na koži postupne vyvíja nerovnomerne zafarbené ložisko. Prejavuje sa ako postupne rastúca makula alebo plak. Obvykle má priemer väčší ako 6 mm.
      
      Pre tento typ melanómu je typická farebná pestrosť ložiska (hnedé, ružové, sivé, belavé).
      
      Nodulárny melanóm (NM)
      Nodulárny melanóm je druhým najčastejším typom malígneho melanómu. Predstavuje 15 až 30 % všetkých melanómov. Vyskytuje sa medzi 50. až 60. rokom života. Postihuje najmä mužov. Môže sa objaviť najmä na trupe a nohách.
      
      Vyrastá v krátkom čase na klinicky nezmenenej koži.
      
      Prejavuje sa ako rôzne veľký, nepravidelne pigmentovaný pologuľovitý hrboľ alebo ako papula. Má hladký povrch, neolupuje sa, rýchlo eroduje a krváca už pri minimálnom poranení. Sfarbenie môže byť hnedé, čierne alebo ružovočervené.
      
      Tvorba metastáz je rýchla najmä v regionálnych uzlinách, pľúcach, mozgu, pečeni, kostiach a na koži. Prognóza nie je priaznivá.

      Akrálny lentiginózny melanóm (ALM)
      Akrálny lentiginózny melanóm predstavuje približne 2 až 8 % prípadov melanómov. Tento typ melanómu sa vyskytuje najmä na dlaniach, chodidlách, v nechtovom lôžku a na slizniciach.
      
      V počiatočných fázach sa prejavuje ako plošné, škvrnito pigmentované nepravidelné ložisko. Toto ložisko môže byť prekryté otlakovými hyperkeratózami. Takým spôsobom je zamaskované.
      
      Pod nechtom pripomína krvácavé zmeny. Na ploskách býva zamenený za melanocytový névus, poranenie, otlak alebo bradavicu. Na akrálne lokalizované melanómy sa často zabúda. Bohužiaľ sú často diagnostikované neskoro.
      
      Subunguálny malígny melanóm
      Subunguálny malígny melanóm postihuje nechtové lôžko. Často sa diagnostikuje neskoro. Vo väčšine prípadov je liečený ako onychomykóza. V niektorých prípadoch je chybne diagnostikovaný ako subunguálna hemorágia po poranení (malé topánky, zakopnutia).
      
      Aké sú ďalšie varianty malígneho melanómu?
      Amelanotický malígny melanóm (AMM)
      Klinicky sa veľmi ťažko diagnostikuje. Zdá sa, že tento typ melanómu je agresívnejší ako pigmentované nádory. Prognóza je zlá.
      
      Desmoplastický malígny melanóm
      Je veľmi vzácny a ťažko diagnostikovateľný. Pigment často chýba.
      
      Malígny melanóm v tehotenstve
      Je všeobecne známe, že v tehotenstve dochádza k zvýšenej produkcii hormónov. Tie stimulujú melanocyty na produkciu pigmentu. Dochádza k tmavnutiu pigmentových lézií. Niekedy k zvýrazneniu už existujúcich malígnych lézií.
      
      Tehotenstvo neovplyvňuje prežívanie pacientiek s diagnostikovaným melanómom. Taktiež nemá vplyv na priebeh ochorenia. V tomto prípade sa pacientky nemusia obávať zvýšeného rizika metastázovania do lymfatických uzlín.
      
      Ako vyzerá malígny melanóm?
      Pre malígny melanóm sú charakteristické zmeny:
      
      veľkosti – nádor je obvykle väčší ako 6 mm, šíri sa plošne a pokrýva čoraz väčšiu plochu
      tvaru – pravidelný okraj sa prehýba a vznikajú na ňom výbežky alebo zárezy
      sfarbenia – najčastejšie dochádza k stmavnutiu až k sčerneniu
      povrchu – tvorba šupín, erózií a krúst
      Diagnostika
      Diagnostika ochorenia je veľmi dôležitá. Pokiaľ je melanóm diagnostikovaný v skorom štádiu, tak prognóza ochorenia býva väčšinou priaznivá.
      V prvom rade sa v diagnostike malígneho melanómu musíme sústrediť na anamnézu, ktorá je zameraná na:
      
      výskyt melanómu
      spôsob opaľovania
      informácie o opakovanom spálení pokožky pri opaľovaní
      opaľovanie sa v soláriu
      vykonanie invazívneho zákroku v postihnutom mieste
      V ďalšom kroku je dôležité posúdenie lézie (tvar a veľkosť). Následne sa vykonáva palpačné vyšetrenie lymfatických uzlín. Lekár taktiež kontroluje kožu kapilícia, dlane, chodidlá, nechty a sliznice.
      
      Na vizuálne diferenciálne diagnostické odlíšenie sa najčastejšie využíva algoritmus ABCD(E):
      
      A (asymmetry) – asymetria ložiska
      
      B (border irregularity) – nepravidelnosť ohraničenia
      
      C (color variegation) – nerovnomerné zafarbenie
      
      D (diameter) – veľkosť nad 6 mm
      
      E (evolution) – vývoj, vyvýšenie ložiska
      
      Logaritmus ABCD(E)

      Tento algoritmus má určité nedokonalosti. V niektorých situáciách, ako napríklad pri malých léziách je nepostačujúci.
      
      Pre zlepšenie diagnostiky sa odporúča ešte pravidlo „škaredého káčatka – ugly duckling“. Uvedené pravidlo vychádza z faktu, že u každého jedinca sa vyskytujú névy podobného typu. A to tak klinicky, ako aj histologicky.
      
      Pokiaľ sa medzi nimi nachádza melanóm, tak má výrazne odlišný vzhľad.
      
      Névus (naevus) – ohraničený kožný útvar, ktorý obvykle vzniká na základe embryonálnej vývojovej poruchy.
      
      K potvrdeniu presného štádia ochorenia musíme poznať jeho celkový rozsah. Z tohto dôvodu bolo do praxe zavedené vyšetrenie sentinelovej uzliny.
      
      Sentinelová lymfadenektómia sa používa za účelom včasného záchytu klinicky nedetekovateľných metastáz. Je to v podstate diagnostická operácia, ktorá má za úlohu zachytiť uzlinové metastázy v klinicky nezistiteľnom štádiu.
      
      Stav spádových uzlín je považovaný za zásadný prognostický faktor, ktorý je rozhodujúci pre indikáciu adjuvantnej systémovej liečby.
      
      Čo je to sentinelová uzlina?
      
      Sentinelová lymfatická uzlina je prvá spádová lymfatická uzlina na priamej drenážnej ceste z miesta primárneho nádoru.
      
      Aká je diagnostika melanómu u detí?
      Melanóm u detí býva väčšinou amelanotický, má pravidelný tvar, je jednofarebný a má veľkosť menšiu ako 6 mm. Vzhľadom k uvedenému klasický algoritmus ABCDE bol modifikovaný.
      
      A (amelanotic) – amelanotický
      
      B (bleeding, bump) – krvácanie
      
      C (color uniformity) – jednofarebný
      
      D (de novo development, any diameter) – novo vzniknutý, bez ohľadu na veľkosť
      
      Dermatoskopia
      V praxi sa najčastejšie využíva ručný dermatoskop. Pri tejto vyšetrovacej metóde sa využíva 10-násobné zväčšenie lézie.
      
      Vďaka zväčšeniu môže lekár lepšie určiť usporiadanie pigmentu v melanocytárnych útvaroch, chovanie kapilár a zistiť prítomnosť zápalových prejavov. Hlavným cieľom dermatoskopického vyšetrenia je odlíšenie:
      
      melanocytovej lézie od nemelanocytovej
      benígnej lézie od malígnej
      V súčasnosti sa využíva metóda digitálnej dermatoskopie. Toto vyšetrenie umožňuje uchovanie dermatoskopického obrazu, jeho opakované hodnotenie a porovnávanie zmien v čase. Pigmentácia je vyhodnocovaná na základe matematickej analýzy.

      Celotelové skenovanie
      Medzi najnovšie diagnostické metódy patrí celotelové skenovanie. Je to neinvazívna metóda. Využíva sa najmä u pacientov s vysokým rizikom vzniku malígneho melanómu.
      
      Záujem o toto vyšetrenie má stúpajúci trend aj u nerizikových pacientov.
      
      Aký je cieľ tejto metódy?
      
      Hlavným cieľom vyšetrenia je detekcia nových alebo výrazne makroskopicky zmenených melanocytových prejavov kože. Táto vyšetrovacia metóda má zmysel len pri opakovaných vyšetreniach pacienta, pretože sleduje zmenu v čase.
      
      Histologická diagnostika melanómu
      Každé podozrenie na melanóm by malo byť indikáciou k jeho chirurgickému odstráneniu a histologickej diagnostike. Histologické vyšetrenie je kľúčové pre stanovenie diagnózy.
      
      Výsledok histopatologického vyšetrenia odstráneného tumoru musí obsahovať makroskopický popis lézie, ktorý zahŕňa:
      
      dĺžku
      šírku
      hrúbku
      prítomnosť krvácania
      krusty
      symetriu
      sfarbenie
      lokalizáciu
      Histologický obraz sa líši v závislosti od jednotlivých typov melanómov. Vo všeobecnosti existujú spoločné znaky malígnej povahy lézie.
      
      Medzi tieto znaky patrí asymetria obrysu a usporiadanie lézie, neostré ohraničenie alebo tvorba nepravidelných rôzne veľkých hniezd nádorových buniek.
      
      Medzi základné požiadavky pri histologickom vyšetrení melanómu zaraďujeme:
      
      hrúbku nádoru v mm – hodnota Breslowa
      počet mitóz na 1 mm2 u nádorov s hrúbkou pod 1 mm
      zhodnotenie prítomnosti/neprítomnosti ulcerácie
      zhodnotenie prítomnosti/neprítomnosti regresie
      šírku bezpečnostného lemu
      Priebeh
      Priebeh a prognóza ochorenia závisia od pokročilosti primárneho nádoru.
      Medzi základné histopatologické parametre, ktoré určujú závažnosť melanómu zaraďujeme:
      
      hrúbku nádoru – označuje sa aj ako hodnota Breslowa
      hĺbku invázie – hodnotí ako hlboko preniká nádor
      povrchovú ulceráciu – vzniká spontánne
      mitotický index – počet mitóz na 1 mm2
      stav sentinelových uzlín – metastázy v tejto uzline výrazne zhoršujú prognózu ochorenia
      V praxi rozlišujeme dve fázy rastu nádoru:
      
      fáza horizontálne-radiálneho rastu – atypické melanocyty prenikajú do vyšších vrstiev epidermis a epidermálnych oblastí vzdialených od miesta primárnej proliferácie melanocytov. Vznikajú pritom klony s rôznou rýchlosťou rastu a tvorby melanínu.
      Fáza vertikálneho rastu – bunky jedného z klonov prenikajú do zamše a ďalej sa množia. Biologicky nepriaznivé vlastnosti nádoru sú spojené s jeho vertikálnym rastom.
      Clark a kol. stanovili prognosticko-histologickú klasifikáciu podľa stupňa invázie:
      
      I. stupeň invázie – nádorové bunky sú len v epidermis nad bazálnou membránou
      II. stupeň invázie – nádorové bunky prenikajú bazálnou membránou do stratum papillare
      III. stupeň invázie – nádorové bunky dosahujú hranicu medzi stratum papillare a stratum reticulare
      IV. stupeň invázie – invázia nádorových buniek medzi kolagénne vlákna
      V. stupeň invázie – invázia nádorových buniek pod kožné tukové tkanivo
      Zamša sa skladá z:
      
      Stratum reticulare – voľná hranica s podkožím, husté kolagénne väzivo
      Stratum papillare – jasná vlnitá hranica s pokožkou, riedke kolagénne väzivo"

      "Content": "Liečba primárneho melanómu
      Základnou liečebnou metódou primárneho melanómu je jeho chirurgické odstránenie. Tento postup je účinný len v prípade, keď je melanóm rozpoznaný včas. A to v dobe, kedy nie je schopný metastázovať.
      
      So stúpajúcou pokročilosťou primárneho melanómu rastie aj jeho agresivita a riziko metastázovania.
      
      Nádor musí byť odstránený s dostatočne širokým lemom zdravého tkaniva. Niektoré lokalizácie nádoru (tvár, dlane, plosky) neumožňujú väčšiu radikalitu. V takých prípadoch je odporúčané dodržanie šírky lemu aspoň 10 mm.
      
      Operačné odstránenie melanómov je vykonávané v špecializovaných pracoviskách. Pri rizikových typoch melanómov sa súčasne odstraňuje aj sentinelová lymfatická uzlina.
      
      V prípade, ak sa nájde v tejto uzline prítomnosť metastatických buniek, tak je potrebné odstrániť všetky uzliny v danej spádovej oblasti.
      
      Rizikový typ melanómu má nasledujúce charakteristiky:
      
      Breslow od 1 mm, ev. 0,75 – 1 mm
      prítomnosť ulcerácie
      vyšší počet mitóz
      pacient mladší ako 40 rokov
      Presné zhodnotenie primárneho melanómu a sentinelovej uzliny je nevyhnutné pre presné stanovenie štádia ochorenia. Umožňuje nám určiť prognózu a následnú liečbu.
      
      U malígnych melanómov s vysokým rizikom ďalšej progresie sa odporúča podávanie adjuvantnej liečby.
      
      Adjuvantná liečba
      V praxi sa stretávame s tým, že až 90 % všetkých metastáz vzniká po piatich rokoch po operácii primárneho melanómu. Približne 10 % sa objavuje v dlhšom časovom odstupe. Niekedy sa metastázovanie môže objaviť aj po 30 rokoch.
      
      Cieľom adjuvantnej liečby je zabránenie takejto progresii ochorenia.
      
      V minulosti sa v adjuvantnej liečbe používali mnohé metódy, ako napríklad chemoterapia, rádioterapia, nešpecifická imunoterapia a iné. Od 80 rokov má veľké uplatnenie adjuvantná aplikácia interferónu-alfa.
      
      Medzi metódy adjuvantnej liečby patria:
      
      Adjuvantná aktinoterapia – využíva sa v prípadoch, kedy nemôžeme dostatočne radikálne odstrániť nádor (ORL a urogenitálne oblasti)
      Adjuvantná chemoterapia
      Adjuvantná imunoterapia – najviac využívaná liečebná metóda pokročilého primárneho nádoru
      Adjuvantná liečba interferónmi
      Interferóny zaraďujeme do skupiny glykoproteínov so širokým spektrom účinkov:
      
      imunomodulačný
      protivírusový
      antiproliferatívny
      prodiferenciačný
      antiangiogénny
      Vo vzťahu k liečbe melanómu sa využívajú rôzne mechanizmy:
      
      stimulácia fagocytózy makrofágov
      zvýšená expresia nádorových antigénov
      priamy cytotoxický účinok
      inhibícia rastu nádorových buniek
      inhibícia angiogenézy
      zníženie syntézy DNA
      Medzi akútne prejavy toxicity interferónovej liečby patrí flu-like syndróm, alopécia, reakcie v mieste vpichu, exacerbácia psoriázy a laboratórne abnormality. Medzi chronické prejavy toxicity patrí anorexia, slabosť a vznik depresie.
      
      Od roku 2011 sa na liečbu malígneho melanómu začali používať monoklonové protilátky. Spôsobujú úpravu imunitného systému. Sú definované ako inhibítory kontrolných bodov imunitnej reakcie organizmu na nádorové bunky melanómu.
      
      K monoklónovým protilátkam patrí ipilimumab. Je schopný priaznivo modulovať bunkovú imunitnú odpoveď organizmu. V porovnaní s inou systémovou liečbou zdvojnásobuje prežívanie pacientov s metastatickým melanómom.
      
      Liečba metastázujúceho melanómu
      Liečba metastázujúceho melanómu patrí do kompetencie chirurga a najmä onkológa. Bohužiaľ, je stále pomerne neúspešná. Na liečbu kožných metastáz sa používa:
      
      chirurgické odstránenie
      interleukíny
      interferóny
      lokálne cytostatiká
      rádioterapia
      fotodynamická liečba
      Uzlinové metastázy sa liečia chirurgicky alebo rádioterapiou. V prípade liečby orgánových metastáz sa okrem chirurgického zákroku používa systémovo podávaná chemoterapia a kombinovaná imunochemoterapia.
      
      V niektorých prípadoch špeciálne rádioterapeutické postupy."

      "Content": "Melanóm je najzhubnejšia forma rakoviny kože (diagnóza C43) so schopnosťou veľmi rýchlo metastázovať. Vzniká zhubnou premenou pigmentových buniek – melanocytov. Na vzniku ochorenia sa podieľajú predovšetkým dva faktory: genetická náchylnosť – predispozícia (napr. svetlý typ kože) a prostredie, v ktorom sa človek pohybuje (UV žiarenie, geografická poloha). Vznik melanómu priamo súvisí s vystavovaním kože UV žiareniu, pričom z hľadiska jeho vzniku je v porovnaní s chronickým slnením nebezpečnejšie práve intenzívne občasné, čiže nárazové opaľovanie a akútne spálenie po krátkom pobyte na slnku. Melanóm je z biologického hľadiska veľmi nebezpečný typ nádoru, pretože „malé zhubné znamienko“ dokáže v krátkom čase „rýchlo zabiť“. Vzniku melanómu však možno predchádzať a keďže sa obyčajne vyskytuje na viditeľných miestach na koži, dá sa jeho prítomnosť včas odhaliť.

      Ide o častý druh rakoviny?
      Výskyt melanómov z roka na rok stúpa. Vek pacientov pritom klesá a výnimkou nie sú dokonca už ani detskí pacienti. K zvýšenému výskytu prispievajú aj dovolenky trávené v exotike (najmä v zimnom období) a fakt, že sa UV žiareniu vystavujeme veľmi nárazovo. Veľkú časť roka trávime v uzatvorených priestoroch a následne sa chceme v krátkom čase rýchlo opáliť, aby sme boli „krásne hnedí“. Svoju úlohu pri zvýšenom výskyte melanómov zohrávajú aj soláriá, o ktorých sa už dnes vie, že sú nebezpečné. Medzinárodná agentúra pre výskum rakoviny (IARC) zaradila zdroje solárií do kategórie „SPÔSOBUJÚCE RAKOVINU“. Významný podiel na výskyte melanómu má aj stenčovanie ozónovej vrstvy. V európskych krajinách sa počet novodiagnostikovaných melanómov každoročne zvyšuje o päť percent. Za posledných 35 rokov sa výskyt melanómu zvýšil až štvornásobne. Na Slovensku bolo podľa najnovších dostupných údajov z roku 2018 viac ako 7400 dospelých pacientov s diagnostikovaným melanómom.
      
      Súvisí melanóm vždy s materským znamienkom?
      Len jedna tretina melanómov vzniká z rôznych druhov pigmentových névov – ľudovo povedané materských znamienok. Dve tretiny vznikajú ako nový útvar „de novo“, na zdravej koži. Melanóm sa objaví ako drobné hnedé, čierne, zriedkavejšie aj ružové ložisko a postupne sa vyvíja. Môže rásť do plochy, ale aj do výšky. Prítomnosť uzlíka na pôvodne plochom ložisku je nutné považovať za znak pokročilého nádoru.
      
      Kde sa melanóm vyskytuje najčastejšie?
      Melanóm je nádor z pigmentových buniek, ktoré sú zodpovedné za hnedé sfarbenie našej pokožky. Aj preto sa vyskytuje najčastejšie na koži a vo väčšine prípadov na plochách, ktoré nárazovo vystavujeme slnečnému žiareniu. Môže sa však vyskytnúť kdekoľvek na tele – napríklad aj v oku alebo na slizniciach, avšak tu je jeho výskyt zriedkavejší.
      
      Melanóm u mužov a u žien
      Výskyt melanómu u mužov a žien je približne rovnaký. Melanóm patril medzi nádory vyskytujúce sa vo vyššom veku, ale v posledných rokoch sa objavuje u stále mladších jedincov. U ľudí mladších ako 40 rokov je výskyt melanómu častejší u žien. Po dovŕšení veku 65 rokov sa dvakrát častejšie vyskytuje u mužov, po osemdesiatke je to dokonca až trikrát častejšie. U žien sa melanómy najčastejšie vyskytujú na dolných končatinách, ramenách a tvári. U mužov na prednej strane hrudníka a chrbte. Súvisí to s odhaľovaním rozličných častí tela UV žiareniu u mužov a žien. V posledných rokoch sa u žien zvýšil výskyt „tenkých“ melanómov s dobrou prognózou, naopak u mužov pozorujeme nárast hrubších, prognosticky horších typov nádorov.
      
      Kedy treba spozornieť?
      Akýkoľvek útvar na koži, ktorý zodpovedá nižšie uvedenej „ABECEDE MELANÓMU“, ale aj malá ranka, ktorá sa podozrivo dlho nehojí, svrbí, štípe či krváca, by mali vzbudiť podozrenie. Melanóm býva vo väčšine prípadov na prvý pohľad iný ako okolité znamienka. Zmena v podozrivom ložisku sa stále vyvíja, mení sa sfarbenie, ohraničenie, veľkosť. Krvácajúce znamienko už môže poukazovať na vyššie štádium rakovinového ochorenia, pretože to znamená, že onkologické bujnenie sa už dostalo ku cievam, ktoré sa v koži nachádzajú hlbšie."

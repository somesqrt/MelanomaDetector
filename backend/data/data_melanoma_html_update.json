Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the commonest form of cancer among Caucasians and its incidence is increasing annually. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma comprise the majority of NMSCs. Surgery is regarded as the 'gold standard' of treatment with high success rates. Several less invasive, topically applied therapies are available for treatment of some cases of BCC and pre-malignant lesions. The development of novel systemic therapies (such as vismodegib) for advanced cases of BCC may herald a paradigm shift from surgical to medical management of NMSCs. Go to: Introduction Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common malignancy among Caucasians.1 NMSC principally comprises basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but includes a host of rarer skin tumours. NMSC incidence is rising annually and is projected to cost the NHS £180 million by 2020.2 Although mortality rates are low, significant morbidity results as lesions commonly occur on sun-exposed sites such as the face.1 Risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer are fair skin, genetic susceptibility, living in areas of high ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, previous occurrence, age and male sex.3 Epidemiology In 2011, over 102,000 cases of NMSC were diagnosed in the UK, 75% of which were BCCs.4 Factors accounting for the rising incidence are the ageing population and greater recreational exposure to UV radiation due to foreign travel and use of sunbeds. There is clear regional variation; the highest rates are in the South West (121.29 and 33.02 per 100,000 person-years for BCC and SCC respectively) and the lowest in London (0.24 and 14.98 per 100,000 person years for BCC and SCC respectively).1 BCC occurs most frequently and accounts for three-quarters of registered cases of NMSC.4 Pathogenesis Exposure to UV radiation initiates approximately 90% of NMSCs.5 Both BCC and SCC result from the malignant transformation of keratinocytes and suppression of the cutaneous inflammatory response.6 Iatrogenic immunosuppression following organ transplantation results in a greater incidence of NMSC, with reversal of the BCC: SCC ratio and occurrence of more aggressive SCC. Caucasian transplant recipients have an increased risk of 65–250 times for SCC and 10–16 times for BCC.7 HIV infection also confers an approximately 2-fold greater risk of NMSC.8 Complex interplay between various factors, including dose of UV radiation, age, skin type, degree and chronicity, contribute to the pathogenesis of NMSC in immunosuppression.7 Physicians should be cognisant that immunosuppressive medications, such as ciclosporin, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, given for indications other than organ transplantation (including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatological disease, vasculitides and atopic dermatitis) will result in a predisposition to NMSC. Patients taking immunosuppressants should use sun protective measures, undertake regular self-surveillance and report suspicious lesions to their clinician for urgent evaluation. Presentation BCC occurs mainly on sun-exposed sites, with 80% appearing on the head and neck and 15% on the trunk.9 Lesions are slow growing and metastases are rare, but local invasion and destruction of surrounding structures can occur if lesions are untreated. There are several histological subtypes of BCC. The classical nodular subtype presents as a pink, pearly papule with overlying telangiectasia and a rolled edge and may have central ulceration (rodent ulcer). Superficial BCCs are slowly enlarging erythematous plaques, which are more frequent on the trunk and can mimic psoriasis, Bowen’s disease or discoid eczema.10 Morphoeic BCCs are more invasive and present at a late stage due to the non-specific appearance of pale, poorly demarcated plaques.10 There is a high degree of overlap among the subtypes of BCC and a mixed histological picture is most commonly encountered.11 SCC may present as ulcers or indurated keratinising lesions on sun-exposed sites. SCCs may develop from pre-malignant lesions, actinic keratoses (AKs) and Bowen’s disease, which is also termed SCC in situ. AKs are a marker of UV-damaged skin and progress to invasive SCC in approximately 1–10% of cases.7 Keratoacanthomas are typically nodular, keratinising lesions, evolving over several months with spontaneous involution. They are histologically indistinct from well-differentiated SCCs and excision is therefore essential for all cases. Management The British Association of Dermatologists has published guidelines for the management of both BCC and SCC, which are under regular review.12,13 Historically, surgery has been the mainstay (‘gold standard’) of treatment. Other treatments can be broadly categorised as physical destruction, chemical destruction and immunomodulation. The last decade has witnessed the advent of novel systemic therapies for advanced BCC, which may herald a paradigm shift of NMSC treatment to a more medical approach. Surgery The aim of surgery is removal of the entire tumour with optimal cosmetic results. Excision of well-defined, low-risk SCCs <2-cm diameter with a 4-mm margin would be expected to remove the primary tumour in 95% of cases.13 Primary BCC is also effectively treated by excision with a 4-mm margin, giving a 5-year recurrence rate of <2%.12 Wider margins or alternative treatment methods are required for larger and poorly differentiated lesions. Mohs micrographic surgery allows for examination of the entire excision margins with staged resection, and provides excellent cure rates for high-risk BCC and SCC.12,13 Physical destruction Radiotherapy has cure rates of up to 90% reported for SCC, 5-year cure rates of 91.3% for primary BCC and 90.2% for recurrent BCC.13–15 Where tissue preservation is paramount (lip, lower eyelid and inner canthus of the eye), for bony or cartilaginous sites and in patients for whom surgery is contraindicated, radiotherapy is often the treatment of choice.13 Primary BCC and recurrent BCC post-surgery can also be successfully treated, although radiotherapy is contraindicated in recurrent BCC post-radiotherapy and naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.7 Inferior cosmetic results previously made radiotherapy a less attractive option for younger patients, but techniques have improved in recent years. Some low-grade BCC and SCC can be treated with physically destructive techniques such as curettage and cautery or cryotherapy, but this does not allow for histological evaluation of margins and may give poor cosmetic outcomes.12 Chemical destruction Over the last two decades, less invasive topically applied treatments have been developed that facilitate chemical destruction of tumours. Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a photosensitising agent (methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) or 5-aminolevulinic acid), activated by a light source. The photosensitiser produces photo-active porphyrins in malignant keratinocytes and illumination then results in the release of reactive oxygen species and free radical formation.16 MAL PDT is licensed for the treatment of BCC in the UK and has shown favourable clinical and cosmetic outcomes in randomised trials in comparison to cryotherapy.12 However, it is not recommended for high-risk tumours unless more effective treatment modalities are inappropriate or refused by the patient. Pain is a further limiting factor. PDT is not approved for SCC, due to the potential for metastases and recurrence, but it is effective in the management of premalignant lesions.16 A specific advantage for AK is the possibility of field treatment of subclinical, photo-damaged skin with excellent cosmetic results. Of note, PDT is less effective in organ transplant recipients on long-term immunosuppression. 5-fluorouracil, which suppresses the enzyme thymidylate synthetase and prevents synthesis of DNA and RNA is also a well-established treatment for small superficial BCCs, as well as the pre-malignant lesions, AKs and Bowen's disease.7 Other chemically destructive topical agents for AKs include diclofenac gel (applied twice daily for three months) and ingenol mebutate gel (applied once daily for only two or three days). Topical agents may invoke an intense inflammatory response, with localised erythema and potential pustulation and ulceration. Immunomodulatory therapy Imiquimod, an immune modifier which acts on toll-like receptors, induces production of cytokines and chemokines from dendritic cells and monocytes.12 Topical 5% imiquimod is licensed in Europe for superficial BCC, but has not shown efficacy for nodular BCC or SCC management.12,13 Medical management Systemic treatment of BCC Mutations of the tumour suppressor gene PTCH1 have recently been identified as underlying 90% of sporadic BCCs as well as naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome).9PTCH1 aberrations generate signalling errors of transmembrane proteins in the hedgehog pathway, causing failure to suppress signalling of the G-protein-coupled receptor smoothened (SMO).9 Manipulation of the PTCH1 and SMO pathways has formed the premise of recent developments in systemic treatment of BCC.17 Oral vismodegib was the first small molecule inhibitor of SMO in the hedgehog pathway, approved for use in January 2012 for locally advanced and metastatic BCC unsuitable for conventional treatment.17 The SafeTy Events in VIsmodEgib (STEVIE) study is an ongoing international multicentre open-label study, representing the most comprehensive data series regarding safety and efficacy of vismodegib to date.18 Interim results showed response rates comparable to previous studies and progression free survival of 20.2 months for the intention to treat population (n = 496). Frequently occurring and cumulative adverse events (affecting over two-thirds of patients) may limit the tolerability of vismodegib for many patients. These include muscle cramps, taste disturbance, weight loss, fatigue and alopecia.3 Similar class effects are seen with other novel hedgehog pathway inhibitors (eg sonidegib) and the possibility of dose alteration to reduce adverse events is under investigation.18 Oral sonidegib 200 mg daily has shown a promising risk-benefit profile for advanced BCC in a recent multi-centre randomised double-blind phase-II trial.19 The antifungal agent itraconazole inhibits the hedgehog pathway via a separate mechanism and is another promising candidate drug being investigated as a systemic treatment for BCC.20 Conclusions The burgeoning incidence of NMSC will continue to present a huge financial and logistical challenge to the NHS, particularly as our population ages. The advent of novel medical therapies is an exciting development, but their long-term efficacy is yet to be determined. Awareness of these common malignancies remains essential for all medical specialties. ​specialties.​​ An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is 62fig1.jpg Fig 1.

            "content": "Abstract Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer and is globally rising. Historically, the diagnosis of skin cancers has depended on various conventional techniques which are of an invasive manner. A variety of commercial diagnostic tools and auxiliary techniques are available to detect skin cancer. This article explains in detail the principles and approaches involved for non-invasive skin cancer diagnostic methods such as photography, dermoscopy, sonography, confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, terahertz spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, the multispectral imaging technique, thermography, electrical bio-impedance, tape stripping and computer-aided analysis. The characteristics of an ideal screening test are outlined, and the authors pose several points for clinicians and scientists to consider in the evaluation of current and future studies of skin cancer detection and diagnosis. This comprehensive review critically analyses the literature associated with the field and summarises the recent updates along with their merits and demerits.IntroductionSkin cancer is a common type of cancer that emerges from the skin. It is extended due to the development of abnormal growth of cells. These cells can invade other parts of the body. More than 90% of cases occur due to the exposure of UV radiation. The UV radiation wavelength ranges from 100 nm to 400 nm. Cancer occurs due to unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells which is caused mostly due to UV radiation. In melanoma, cancer cells arise from moles on the skin which causes inflammation around the epidermal layer which in turn increases the temperature around it.1A survey in 2015 found about 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths occurred due to cancer. As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, considering limited health care resources. Past statistics and trends are shown in Fig. 1. In 2017, out of 5.4 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer, only 3.3 million people were treated in the US. Over 87[thin space (1/6-em)]110 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the US, but estimation found that 9730 people will die of melanoma due to lack of healthcare resources. About 2 to 4% cases of people are suffering from melanoma skin cancer in India.1 In a report published ten years ago, skin cancer ranked 10th as the most common cancer in Malaysia and accounted for 2.6% of all cancer cases in the country. Melanoma is not very prevalent in Malaysia and occurred in only 5.4% of the patients who attended the dermatology clinic in Hospital Kuala Lumpur, but awareness among them is very less.2 At present, between two and three million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132[thin space (1/6-em)]000 melanoma skin cancers happen globally every year. According to the recent research on skin cancer trends in Asia, it was found that skin cancer rates among the fairer-skinned were approximately three times higher than those who generally have darker complexions. Prevalence rates of skin cancer in Singapore increased from 1968 to 2006, especially among older Chinese.3Fig. 1 shows (a) recent stats and (b) stages of skin cancer. (Data source: NCI SEER Cancer Stat Facts).7Classifications of skin cancerSkin cancer is categorized into three types which are basal cell skin cancer, squamous skin cancer and malignant skin cancer. The first two skin cancers are grouped together as non-melanoma skin cancers. The stages of skin cancer is shown in Fig. 1.4 The features and the treatment involved in each type of cancers are discussed below.Basal cell skin cancerBasal cancer cell (BCC) is the least aggressive of non-melanoma skin cancer derived from keratinocytes that resemble epidermal basal cells.5 BCC appears like a flesh coloured pearl likes a bump or a pinkish patch of skin. BCC is due to skin exposure especially found in the sun exposed areas such as the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and abdomen. BCC can spread over the body and grows in nerves and bones. BCC is often known as non-melanoma cancer.6 BCC occurs in at least 2–3 millions of people per year. BCC has low death rate. It can be cured by simple treatment like radiation therapy and tropical medications such as fluorouracil.Squamous cell carcinomaSquamous cancer cell (SCC) is the cancer of keratinocyte cells found on the outer surface of the skin. It appears like a red firm bumps scaly patches. It is caused due to over sun exposure. It is more commonly found in people who have pale light skin. It is mainly found in the regions like ear, face, neck, chest, and back. More than 1 million of people were affected due to SCC and 80[thin space (1/6-em)]000 people died. In past three decades, there is huge increase in SCC among the US. The death rate of SCC is higher than BCC but comparatively lower than melanoma. BCC and SCC carry the ultraviolet radiation and damage the DNA directly. SCC results in ulceration and ends up with bleeding disorders. It should be treated at the earlier stage else it will grow in the dense amount in the body. SCC is characterized by proliferation of invasive squamous cells which are able to invade other tissues. It can be treated by photodynamic therapy, tropical chemotherapy, and curettage and electrodessication. SCC is the second common cancer in the world. It is not dangerous than that of melanoma.4,8Malignant melanomaMelanoma arises from melanocytes, specialized pigmented cells that are found abundantly in basal layer of epidermis.9 Malignant melanoma consist of four major histological subtypes frequently reported namely superficial spreading melanoma (70%), nodular melanoma (15%), lentigo maligna melanoma (13%), and acral lentiginous melanoma (2–3%).10 Melanoma is usually observed as a dark spot on the epidermal (outer) layer of the skin. It is the fast-growing cancer cells that have the ability to spread over the surrounding tissue of the body. The malignant melanoma is caused due to UV radiation and damages the DNA indirectly. The free radical and the reactive oxygen species are the two leading causes of DNA damage. Research indicates that intentness of sunscreen components into the skin, conjugate with 60 min exposure to UV leads to the increase of free radical in the skin.8 Globally in 2012 malignant melanoma occurred among 232[thin space (1/6-em)]000 people, and 55[thin space (1/6-em)]000 people have died.11 Malignant melanoma is the deadliest cancer, but it can be cured at early stages of cancer. It is normally treated with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy.Detection of skin cancer in the early stage is useful in treating the condition very quickly. Detection systems pave the way for the diagnosis, but the result was not that precise comparing to biopsy test which is an invasive method. Along with the cost involved, the after-effects of biopsy include severe infectious problem around the punctured area. If the condition found to be more severe in the biopsy test, then surgery is performed, this adds to the cost along with the complexities. Other methods like radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drug therapy can be given, but the loss of hair and sittings often makes the patient to the worst condition. By taking into account all these points, many sensors are fabricated and designed to detect the skin cancer in a non-invasive manner, unlike biopsy. In this comprehensive review article, the recent non-invasive approaches involved in skin cancer detections are summarised.Literature search performedThe literature search was performed using Google Scholar. The search was carried out for the keywords “Skin cancer, detection techniques, diagnosis, non-invasive” for the time span of 1990–2017. From the search, relevant articles were presented, and some articles were chosen based on the pertinence. Publication trends over the years are shown in Fig. 2.

In this section briefly explained about the principle and detection mechanisms involved in skin cancer diagnosis as shown in Fig. 4. Along with that presented the currently practiced skin cancer diagnosis methods and techniques.12Fig. 3 Roadmap of skin cancer diagnosis.image file: c8ra04164d-f4.tifFig. 4 Principles and mechanisms for skin cancer detection.Principles and mechanisms involvedOptical. When the light is passed into the tissues, the light gets scattered within the tissues of the skin. The change in the property of the reflected light is used for diagnosis.13 Advanced biochemical markers are also developed with respect to cancerous tissue and specific wavelengths are used to enhance the contrast of the tissue by absorbing light.14,15Photodynamic based. In order to detect the presence of tumor cells, a photosensitive marker is introduced into the particular area. Protoporphyrin IX is formed as a result of chemical reactions inside the body, which is absorbed by the healthy cells but gets accumulated in the tumour cells. When the resectoscope is introduced into the area, under blue illumination the accumulated pigment in the tumour cells emit red fluorescence and normal cells will be in blue. To provide contrast for photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) yellow-light filter is specially designed which enhances the red fluorescence. Skin lesions using photodynamic diagnosis are based on the fluorescent properties of an exogenous and endogenous compound in response to illumination. Stimulation of photosensitizers is made to produce the photodynamic effect when a certain wavelength of light is exposed to it.12,16Sonography. Sound waves are used in this approach. After transmitting sound pulses into the body, some of the sound waves get reflected back to the probe, while some travel on farther until they arrive another boundary and get reflected. The reflected waves are sensed by the probe and relayed to the machine. The changes in the property of sound waves are used in this technique. Sonography is used to assess skin lesion depth and margins before doing the biopsy and also used to classify adjacent lymph nodes whether it has become cancerous or not. This is added to a patient's protocol to clarify lesion depth, identify margins for excision, and determine lymph node. It has the ability to differentiate benign from malignant skin cancer. It is used to identify metastatic lymph nodes visually, which avoids unnecessary removal of lymph nodes. The main advantage is that it gives the accurate results of measuring skin cancer lesion thickness.17Electrical bio-impedance. The electrical impedance of skin, when measured by topical application of electrodes, is dominated by the high resistance of the stratum corneum. Changes in stratum corneum hydration or structure can be followed by electrical measurements at low frequency. Stratum corneum must be bypassed to measure the living epidermis and dermis. Direct contacts of microneedles on stratum corneum penetrate and measure the electrical activity underlying the skin.18Thermal imaging. Thermography is based on the phenomenon that any object of a temperature above absolute zero emits electromagnetic radiation. There is a definite relationship between the surface of a body and the intensity and spectral composition of its emitted radiation. By determining its radiation intensity, the temperature of an object can thereby be determined in a non-contact way. The human skin is a thermal interface with the human environment. Temperature distribution on the skin will be emitted in the infrared band that is useful in imaging the thermal distribution. Infrared cameras are used in clinical medicine to map the thermal distribution in the human body. Stress is applied to the imaging region so that the liquid crystal plate directly over the body make useful in capturing the image. Thermal imaging can also be performed in a non-contact manner through the infrared camera of high sensitivity. Comparing to other techniques which have false negative reports at a high probability, thermography provides high accuracy.19Techniques and methodsPhotographyTotal Body Photography (TBP) is also known as mole mapping which is used to identify patients with numerous nevi and changes in the lesions during regular skin examinations.20 TBP uses the digital camera for recording and storing the images as shown in Fig. 5. Using a high-resolution, professional medium-format camera, images are taken from the subjects by implementing the camera at different poses and position of the subject to get accurate results.21 Once the image is taken, it is digitally processed using mirror body mapping software. Sum of all the images is analyzed using this software. The software later generates an interactive, stand-alone program (DermaGraphix)22 containing the patient's body map. This stand-alone DermaGraphix body map, which is given to the patient using USB 2.0, tier 1 thumb drive.23 This system can also be performed at home by oneself, but the cost of equipment is high.24Fig. 5 (a) Illustrates the total body imaging using photographic devices and (b) shows general steps in image processing technique for skin cancer diagnosis. Reproduced under CC license form ref. 43.Lynn T. Dengel, Gina R. Petroni and Craig L. Slingluff et al. had a significant finding of photography method in screening of skin cancer, but it is not used widely used due to time and cost.20 In this technique, captured the surface images of the skin to identify suspicious and pigmented lesions in high-risk patients primarily. Image processing algorithms are applied to the captured images for detecting any abnormalities in the skin. The segmentation technique which is used to detect the skin lesion is classified as region-based segmentation and neural edge detection. In region-based segmentation method, the optimal threshold is determined iteratively by an isodata algorithm. In neural network edge detection, an approximate closed elastic curve between the recognized neural network edge patterns is fitted.25Computer-aided decision tools are essential in medical imaging for diagnosis and evaluation of various diseases.26 The acquired image from the subject using high-resolution camera is pre-processed to reduce the artefacts. To overcome the artefacts like the presence of hair in the image, mean, median, Gaussian and anisotropic filters are employed. It is followed by the detection of the lesion by image segmentation technique that partition the image into disjoint areas that are homogeneous concerning a chosen property such as luminance, colour, and texture. Next process is feature extraction.27 The extraction process takes by ABCD rule that checks the symmetrical, border, colour, and the diameter of the acquired image. Once the lesion is localized, different chromatic and morphological features can be quantified and used for classification.28 In the classification part, bringing out the algorithm in the examination process combines visual processing with deep learning.29 In deep learning, the computer is trained to figure out a problem rather than having the answers programmed into it.The computer-aided technique is used to segment the melanocytes in the images taken from the skin. This segmentation is made mostly to reduce the local intensity variant. The mean-shift algorithm is adapted.30 The digital images of melanoma skin lesions can provide information about the skin cancer at an early stage without performing any skin biopsies.31 The mathematical morphology has been used for segmentation for proper identification of skin lesion area. Using TBP, different shape, texture and colour features are extracted and malignant melanomas have been classified sensitively.32 Delaunay triangulation is a technique used to extract a binary mask of the lesion region, which doesn't require any training. This is highly accurate when dealing with benign lesions, while the segmentation accuracy significantly decreases when melanoma images are processed. Geometrical and colour features were extracted from the binary masks generated by the algorithm for classification, which gives accurate results for melanoma detection.33Computer-aided diagnosis extended its framework for the detection of skin cancer in recent years. The detection of melanoma skin cancer in the early stage will be very useful to cure it and safeguard the life of the affected individuals. authors Abdul Jaleel, Sibi Salim, R. B. Aswin et al. found that based on imaging techniques and artificial intelligence the result of computer-aided detection of skin cancer is based.34 Computer vision plays a vital role in medical image diagnosis. Reported the computer-aided diagnosis for the pigmentations of skin lesions to determine the presence of skin cancer by performing the boundary detection.35 Skin lesions can also be analysed by qualification of degree of symmetry. The other paper explains that melanoma can be diagnosed by wavelet and texture analysis.36 The texture features were derived from the wavelet decomposition and the border features were collected from the lesions borders and the selections of such features were collected by using the gain-ratio method. That was computationally efficient for the melanoma diagnosis. In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis extended its framework in mobile technologies and in cloud platforms. By this method, the system can able to classify the lesions by identifying the moles in skin images and classify them accordingly as melanoma, benign and nevus lesions.37 Computer diagnosis can also be used as a preventive tool in the detection of skin cancer via mobile phone applications. By using this technique, the melanocytes can be separated from the histopathological images.38Smartphone plays an active role in medical diagnostic of skin cancer by considering the sensitivity, specificity etc. The non-clinician users can easily differentiate the malignant and benign tumours.39 Through the computer-aided method, the patients can identify the skin cancer without going to the hospital.40 Computer-aided diagnosis can be carried out in the field of image processing, pre-processing, feature extraction, segmentation and classification of demographics images.34 Computer-aided melanoma diagnosis is used to provide the support to the physicians in enhancing the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of melanoma condition. To capture the images of skin lesions, optoelectronic probe were used.41 One of the articles reveals that computer-aided diagnosis can be used to detect the early stage of melanoma by applying the image processing technique. Images can be analysed based on ABCD technique which involves asymmetry, border, colour, diameter etc. From the skin lesion images, the above parameters were collected by considering the texture, size and shape of the image.26 These features were extracted from the images and it was further processed for image segmentation. The extracted features were used to distinguish the normal skin and the melanoma cancer lesions as shown in Fig. 5b. The other methods deal with the image processing in which the images of the affected areas are captured by using the camera of the mobile phone by moving the diffraction grating. Thus the skin cancer can be diagnosed.42 Recent updates on photography techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 1.Table 1 Recent reports on photography based techniques for skin cancer diagnosisS. no.

Modern dermoscope as shown in Fig. 6, do not use this liquid medium; instead, it uses polarised light that eliminates the skin reflection.51 From this method, the non-cancerous and cancerous condition can be known. Basically, this dermoscope operates under three modes, first is, non-polarised in a contact manner, second is polarised light in a contact manner then the third mode is polarised light in a non-contact manner. The main advantage of using polarized light is, it provides better visualization in deeper skin structures whereas for non-polarized the information will be only on the superficial layer of skin.52 In this system, the accuracy level is increased based on the experience of the clinician.53Fig. 6 (a) and (b) shows different types of dermoscopes. (a) Reproduced under CC license from ref. 71.Dermoscopy shows subsurface structures of the skin with the use of handheld devices that extend optical light ray penetration beyond the skin surface and minimize surface reflection. In contrast, naked eye examination limits visualization of certain skin structures because the stratum corneum has reflective properties. Dermoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis of skin cancer. It has higher discriminating power than a clinical analysis. The report made by Marie-Lise Bafounta, Alain Beauchet, Philippe Aegerter, on the diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer shown that sensitivity and the specificity54 obtained by dermoscopy techniques were comparatively higher than clinical analysis. Skin lesion on the face was usually diagnosed by comparing the dermoscopic features of lentigo senilis and lentigo malinga55 based on logistic regression method. Dermoscopy plays a crucial role in distinguishing the melanoma cells from benign cells with the help of various diagnostic tools56 such as pattern analysis, ABCD rule, Menzies method, and 7-point checklist. The dermoscopic studies were made on 20 pigmented skin lesions57 based on the pattern analysis and the results were found to be more accurate. Dermoscopy techniques are used to analyze the vascular structure58 of melanocytic and non-melanocytic tumors based on their morphological behaviour of the skin. Dermoscopy extends its application in early diagnosis of malignant melanoma and differential59 diagnosis of pigmented lesions of the skin by in vivo methods. The study was made on 2522 skin cancer subjects60 based upon the accuracy rate, dermoscopy techniques showed better results than conventional technique, but the main drawback of this technique is that it requires a high-resolution camera to capture the images of skin lesions.Boundary detection technique which uses gradient vector flow for detecting the boundary is explained. The initialization method is automatic which makes the skin lesion border determination fully automated.61 The unsupervised approach for skin lesion images based on modified version of JSEG algorithm for detecting the border is used. The border detection error is quantified by a metric which uses manually determined borders by the dermatologist.62 An approach which is based on detecting the border using statistical region merging algorithm is reported. The border detection error is quantified by a metric which has three sets of dermatologist determined border as the base. This method is compared with four states of automated methods.63 A new method to detect and visualize the pigment network structures in the images already extracted has been reported. This detection is based on the automatic detection of the edges of pigment network structure which forms cyclic graphs. The extracted image is first pre-processed which gives the binary image; the binary image is then converted into graph and cyclic subgraphs which corresponds to the skin texture. These cyclic subgraphs are filtered to remove round structures.64 The mobile application uses the image processing technique for the prevention of melanoma. This system comprises of a microscope and a smartphone. The microscope is to image the area of skin, whereas smartphone is to get the output.65 The artefact is removed, and the borders of the lesion are detected by using border detection technique in the captured images.39Dermoscopy also employed in the diagnosis of melanoma condition in pregnant women. The study was made on 35 pregnant women66 and the results showed that the pregnancy leads to significant modifications in pigmented skin lesions. Border detection67 method was used in dermoscopy techniques to enhance the accuracy level of the diagnosis of skin cancer. Mostly for non-melanoma68 skin cancer such as SCC and BCC are diagnosed by dermoscopic methods due to its high resolution. Using dermoscopy, the irregular streaks in melanoma can be detected by performing a three-way classification of streaks which involves regular, absent and irregular in a pigmented skin lesions.69 Esteva et al., employed the deep convolutional neural network to classify melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer.70 Latest reports on dermoscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 2.Table 2 Recent reports on dermoscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosisS. no.

Piezoelectric materials are ideal for this.72 The typical transducer consists of a disk-shaped piezoelectric element that is made vibrating by applying an electrical impulse via an electrode on each side of the disc. Likewise, the echo returning to the disk makes it vibrate, creating a small electrical potential across the same two electrodes that can be amplified and recorded.73 In modern clinical scanners, the transducer consists of hundreds of small piezoelectric elements arranged in a 1D array packed into a small enclosure.74 Thus the generated acoustic waves propagate in the fluid or surrounding tissues, from where these structures reflect the echoes which are collected back in the transducer which then transforms into electrical energy.75 This signal is then processed to get the image of the tumours in a required dimensional form. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), or optoacoustic imaging, is insensitive to photon scattering in the biological tissue and, unlike conventional optical imaging techniques, this technique makes high-resolution optical visualization.76–79Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an imaging method that produces high-resolution optical images in scattering media, including biological tissues. This technique is also known as functional photoacoustic tomography. MSOT illuminates tissue with light of transient energy, typically light pulses lasting 1–100 nanoseconds. The tissue absorbs the light pulses, and as a result undergoes thermo-elastic expansion, a phenomenon known as the optoacoustic or photoacoustic effect. This expansion gives rise to ultrasound waves (photo echoes) that are detected and formed into an image as shown in Fig. 7.80–82 The process is carried out with the help of computer where the image displayed on the screen is useful in diagnosing the lesions.83 The images are obtained in vertical sections are both the resolution and penetration vary according to the frequency. A retrospective study examined the usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound in the diagnosis of BCC through the identification of hyper-sonographic spots. This study concludes the conflicts between hyper-sonographic spots versus hypersonic spots in differentiating BCC and melanoma.12Fig. 7 Integrated real-time photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging.Sonography is the pre-operative studies which measures the thickness of the tumor and internal echo density.17,84 Ultrasound of B-scan technique is interfaced with the computer which uses 20 MHz frequency transducer in acquiring the image.74 40 MHz ultrasound gives higher resolution than 20 MHz.85 El Gammal et al. demonstrated the detection of melanoma using 100 MHz frequency which provided higher resolution and detailed visualization of skin layers.86 High-frequency sonography which is coupled with color Doppler gives 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in detection of melanoma.87,88 Ultrasonography is used to produce 3-dimensional imaging and detects the border of the lesions.89 White light digital photography in combination with reflex transmission imaging, which is a form of high-resolution ultrasound used to classify the pigmented lesions.90 Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is used to study the primary lesion and gives information about the non-surgical treatment. Sonoelastography is used to study the mechanical behaviour of the skin lesions.91,92 Melanoma appears as hypoechoic or as heterogeneous oval structure under ultrasound detection.93 Detailed anatomic data about the primary tumor is provided by sonography.94 Retrospective analysis is done by ultrasound for pre-surgical examinations.95 Fine-needle aspiration cytology is also used as a minimally invasive technique of ultrasound in detecting melanoma.96–98 Recent summarization of ultrasound techniques for skin cancer diagnosis is presented in Table 3.Table 3 Recent reports on ultrasound based techniques for skin cancer diagnosisS. no.

This light is then absorbed inside the tissue producing a localized temporary thermoelastic expansion. This expansion leads to the emission of ultrasound, which is detected by the transducer. Finally, a photoacoustic image is generated and displayed in real-time.Confocal microscopyConfocal microscopy is a non-invasive technique that allows examination of the skin with cellular resolution. It uses a focused laser beam to illuminate a specific point within the skin and measures the reflection of light from that point as shown in Fig. 8. Multiple points are scanned across an area parallel to the skin surface to construct a grayscale image.100 Different depths can also be imaged to form optical sections. A confocal microscope includes a light source, a condenser, an objective lens and a detector. A confocal microscope uses point illumination and a pinhole in an optically conjugate plane in front of the detector to avoid out-of-focus signal – the name “confocal”.101 This configuration permits the collection of light from the single in-focus plane and dismissal of light from all out-of-focus planes. The light source illuminates a small 3-D spot (voxel) within a sample, such as skin, from which mirrored light is collected to produce a pixel.102 The illuminated spot is then scanned horizontally over a 2-D grid to obtain a horizontal microscopic section. This process is known as “optical sectioning” of the image in a series of horizontal planes stacked vertically to produce an image pixel by pixel, with an axial thickness of 2–5 μm.103 This property enables a confocal microscope to look at a slice in the body of a thick semi-transparent sample, whereas, conventional microscopes visualize all the planes contemporarily.Fig. 8 Confocal microscopy imaging technique. In image (i) (A and B) showing hand held RCM probes and (C and D) showing wide probe RCM, reprinted from ref. 110 with permission from Elsevier, and (ii) showing its mechanism, reproduced under CC license from ref. 111.Confocal microscopy provides the capacity for direct, non-invasive, serial optical screening for thick, living specimens with least of sample preparation as well as a minimal improvement in lateral resolution, commonly called reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM). In vivo RCM is a non-invasive technique that allows examination of the skin with cellular resolution. Resolution is almost comparable to the conventional histology. It has the advantage of allowing the clinician to do a “virtual biopsy” of the skin and obtain diagnostic clues while minimizing unnecessary skin biopsies.104Various skin disorders of which both hyper-pigmentary and hypo-pigmentary lesions can be detected using confocal microscopy.105 Also in combination with Raman spectroscopy at various wavelength, confocal microscopy provide better cellular details.106 The recent study involves the usage of vivascope107 with the extended version which offers better imaging. From 488 to 700 nm, the laser source can be used to illuminate the tissue non-invasively to know the depth nature of tissues and its complications.108 Multispectral polarized light imaging (MSPLI) and confocal microscopy combination provide better accuracy details in results rather an individual system.109 Recent progress in confocal microscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis is presented in Table 4.Table 4 Recent updates on confocal microscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosisS. no.

It depends on Raman scattering of monochromatic radiations, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared and near UV rays.116 In Raman scattering, inelastic collisions take place between the photons of an irradiating laser beam and the sample (or tissue) molecules.117 The obtained spectra can be processed and analyzed in order to provide automated feedback at the time of measurement.118 This system provides better sensitivity in differentiating the tissues.119Fig. 9 Raman spectroscopy technique. In image (a) showing hand held probe, (Courtesy of Verisante Technology Inc., Canada; with permission) and (b) showing the Raman spectroscopy mechanism.One of the article deals with the classification of skin lesion using Raman spectra by a non-linear neural classifier.120 The classification model is highly probabilistic and automated. This model involves the feature extraction for Raman spectra and a fully adaptive robust feed-forward neural classifier. The component analysis of Fourier transform Raman spectra of ex vivo basal carcinoma can be diagnosed by using the Nd:Yag laser at the wavelength of 1064 nm acting as an excited source in FT Raman RFS100/s spectrometer.121 Thirty-nine set of human skin samples were collected. Among the 39 samples, 18 samples were found to be histopathologically diagnosed as non-diseased and 21 samples were found to be BCC. Raman microspectroscopy is mostly done on in vivo method. It is a non-invasive, automated and real-time application to diagnosis the non-melanoma skin cancer which includes both BCC and SCC which can calibrate the sample within less than 1 second.122 By using the confocal Raman system1 with a handheld probe, the Raman spectra of 21 suspected non-melanoma skin cancers in 19 subjects with matched normal skin spectra were collected to analyse the pathological condition. Small distinctive bands corresponding to specified Raman spectra of lipids and proteins are used to distinguish the skin lesions. Raman Spectra of various compounds can be analysed by using the partial least regression and discriminate analysis.123 Raman spectroscopy plays a major role in the study of static and dynamic properties of the biologically significant molecule in solution, living cells and cell culture etc. The contribution of various bio-compounds such as lipids and proteins in the tissue can be estimated by providing a linear least square fitting model, to analysis the skin cancer in the tissue regions.119 Raman spectroscopy can also be used as a developmental tool in medical diagnosis. By shifting the excitation energy of Raman spectroscopy from the visible to NIR regions, the fluorescence components present within the normal cells can be minimized. The software tools have been developed to interpret the spectra of the tissue to diagnose the affected areas of the tissues regions.124 Cluster analysis plays a significant role in the classification of Raman spectra of malignant tumours from normal cells.125 Latest updates on Raman spectroscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are summed in Table 5.Table 5 Recent reports on Raman spectroscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosisS. no.

It is used to detect the skin cancer with the help of fluorophores. Reprinted from ref. 145 with permission from Elsevier.A study was conducted by E. Borisova and his team on fluorescence spectroscopy; they noticed that excitation spectrum are usually identical to the absorption spectrum, as the fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the absorption.132 The non-melanoma skin cancer can be diagnosed by the fluorescence polarization imaging technique, in which the tunable monochromatic light source along with CCD camera is employed to detect the tumour cells.133 As a result, two fluorophores were retained in tumours. Hyperspectral fluorescence is the one of the technique used to diagnosis the skin cancer in which the two ultrafast lasers were used operating at the wavelength of 355 nm that excites the auto-fluorescence between the bio-molecules that resides in the skin tissue.134 Auto-fluorescence technique is used to capture the images of the pigmented skin lesions, in which both the fluorescence and reflectance were studied.135 The excitation source used in this method is fibre coupled laser operated at the wavelength of 785 nm and the illumination of a light source is filtered by bandpass filter in order to acquire the fluorescence imaging and the reflectance imaging were obtained by the selection of components of the long pass filter. Auto-fluorescence technique is used to select the sampling points for the Raman spectroscopy, based on that the classification of various skin lesions was performed.136 Fluorescence spectroscopy is used to determine the distribution of biological substances by employing the fluorescent agent.137 The excitation source that causes fluorescence has been integrated with fiber optic probes to examine the tissue and it was recorded by using spectrograph. Fluorescence spectroscopy technique can also be used to classify the benign from malignant tumors with the help of fluorescence spectra by in vivo method. As a result, the normal tissues were found to be the wavelength of 440 nm and the non-melanoma tissues were found to be at the wavelength of 436 nm.138 Fluorescence spectroscopy has the ability to distinguish the cancerous cells from the non-cancerous cells.139 The monochromatic radiation is used as an excitation source at the wavelength of 300 nm. From the tissue two sets of fluorescence were emitted at the wavelength of 340 nm and 440 nm. The difference in intensity between the two fluorescence will decide whether the tissue is a malignant or a benign tumour.140PDD of doubtful skin lesions relies on the fluorescent properties of an exogenous drug or endogenous compound in response to a light source. Topical agents are utilized to stimulate the reproduction of endogenous photosensitizers that produce a photodynamic effect when exposed to the light of specific wavelengths and energy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the combination of absorption light and the photosensitizer.141 This technique also helps prior to surgery to detect the cancerous cells by using the photosensitizer. Fluorescence spectroscopy is performed on the tissues by using the photo sensitizer.142 Non-melanoma skin cancer can be diagnosed by fluorescence spectroscopy by both in vivo and ex vivo method. Auto-fluorescence is used to detect the presence of an abnormality in malignancy. The fluorescence intensity of dermal collagen is generally lower in tumour than in the normal tissues.143 Synchronous fluorescence method with time-resolved fluorescence technique can also be used for this applications.144 Modern reports on fluorescence spectroscopy methods for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 6.Table 6 Recent reports on fluorescence spectroscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosisS. no.

It is an imaging technique, which is used to detect the epithelial cancers. Time domain analysis is used to differentiate between diseased and healthy tissues, which are significant statistically. The location of a tumour is well correlated and increased in terahertz absorption. Diagnosis of skin cancer using frequency domain analysis in terahertz spectroscopy is by using in vitro techniques and by using tetrahertz pulsed imaging (TPI). Then data manipulation is done to determine the spectral information which is related to depth.146Fig. 11 Tetrahertz Spectroscopy. In this technique the properties of matters are probed with short pulses of THz radiations. In the above image (i) showing TPI handheld probe system, (A) main unit with computer monitor, handheld imaging probe and black umbilical cord (visible on the right), (B) close up of the handheld imaging probe, (C) close up of the head of the imaging probe showing the black quartz window. The probe scans an area of 15 × 2 mm, and acquires data from 26 pixels (red), reproduced under CC license from ref. 156; and (ii) showing the THz mechanism, reproduced under CC license from ref. 157.The pulsed THz spectrometry is used to analyse the dielectric properties of the human skin.147 Using this technique, the contrast between the BCC and normal healthy skin was found. The THz material parameter can encounter the dysplastic and non-dysplastic nevi pigmentation and it was compared with the normal healthy skin. A skin tissue model has been developed for the THz wavelength and has been estimated for a Monte Carlo simulation of the polarized light and scattering. The studies were made based upon the Mueller matrices in order to diagnosis the skin cancer.148 In accordance with the novel optic system, it is used to capture the images of the neoplastic and the non-neoplastic colon tissue with close to the wavelength – limited spatial resolution at the spatial resolution of 584 GHz frequency were employed to study the carcinoma tissues.149 THz technology plays an important role in medical diagnosis.T waves also extends its application in both electrical and optical method to diagnose the skin cancer by means of plamonic photoconductive antenna of high sensitivity.150,151 THz spectroscopy also used to analyse the biological tissues by integrating the IR camera with IR detector.152 Using the THz imaging at the range of 1.39–1.63 THz the non-cancerous and cancerous cells can be differentiated.153 It also extended its application in the domain of biomedical which ranges from the bio-molecules includes lipids, proteins, amino acids to cells and tissues.154 It is used in sensing applications, involves detection of concealed objects, explosive detection of identifications, space exploration and THz cancer detections.155 Contemporary updates on THz spectroscopy approaches for skin cancer diagnosis are compiled in Table 7.Table 7 Recent reports on Tetrahertz spectroscopy for skin cancer diagnosisS. no.

OCT is a non-invasive method that allows 2 or 3-dimensional cross-sectional visualization of the microstructural morphology of tissues.158 It provides better depth resolved image than ultrasound imaging. OCT is an in vivo technique which works on the principle of interference (Michelson interferometry) of infrared radiation and living tissues which is the major reason for high resolution. The interferometer in an OCT scanner splits a broadband source field into a reference field and sample field. The sample field focuses through the scanning optics and the objective lens to some point below the surface of the tissue. The back scattered beam from the tissue combines with the reflected beam from the reference mirror, forming an interference pattern which is detected by the photodetector.159 Structures of normal skin, including the epidermis, dermo-epidermal junction, dermis, hair follicles, blood vessels and sweat ducts can be clearly visualized by this method. This technique allows the differentiation between the benign and malignant epithelial tissue by the qualitative and quantitative assessment of OCT images. It enables the optical biopsy of epithelial lesions.160Fig. 12 Optical coherence tomography. In the above image (a) showing a hand held OCT device, reproduced under CC license from ref. 176 and (b) showing the OCT mechanism.A report was made by Michael R. Hee, Joseph A. Izatt, Joseph M. Jacobson, James G. Fujimoto, and Eric A. Swanson, who made a significant finding on OCT by introducing a trans-illuminance property in femtosecond laser.161 Famous authors Alexander M. Sergeev and Valentin M. Gelikonov found that longitudinal scanning of human tissue has good accuracy comparing to transverse scanning.162 authors also used CCD camera to detect the photons but failed in showing the wider field of view.163 Cross-sectional image of human skin is obtained with higher accuracy.164 It has been proved that longer wavelength can minimize the influence of multiple scattering on image contrast and resolution; thus increase the effective penetration depth of OCT.165 Combination of both OCT and optical Doppler tomography (ODT) shows better results in scanning speed of acquiring the image.166 Even for detecting the inflammation on the skin, lesions on the skin and other infection over skin apart from tumour detection can also be performed by OCT.167 Heterogeneous property of tissue shows that collagen level in tissue can also rate the tumor growth.168 Later researchers like Aneesh Alex, Jessika Weingast and Martin Weinigel, reported that the combination of multi photon tomography (MPT) and OCT showed better resolution and high penetration depth.169 To overcome the conflicts in differentiating the non-tumour and tumour, deep margins are detected in the region of interest using the OCT.170 Increased thermal property of tissue shows various dysfunction of metabolic activity. The epidermal region shows higher thermal coefficient in the cancer patient.171 Also, the density of normal skin and tumour occurred in the skin varies.172 OCT reduces the Mohs micrographic surgery.173 Measurement of epithelial density can also be performed by OCT directly.174 Currently; precise tumour depth is performed by three methods combination namely, OCT, optoacoustic and Raman spectroscopy which shows the better results.175 Recent updates on OCT approaches for skin cancer diagnosis are compiled in Table 8.Table 8 Recent reports on OCT techniques for skin cancer diagnosisS. no.

The spectral and spatial information of the samples are simultaneously recorded by the multispectral image spectrometer, in which the acquired images from a monochrome camera is processed using spectral and polarization filtering that provides high contrasting images which is useful in identifying the pathological and morphological features of the suspicious skin lesions.177–179 Refer to Fig. 13 shows the multimodal spectroscopy setup for skin cancer diagnosis. The report was made by Hagen Nathan, Kudenov Michael on multispectral imaging based on spectral bands. In this, the image analysis is done automatically and pattern recognition is used to identify lesions which in turns help in further biopsy. It plays an important role in the diagnosis of skin cancer by considering the parameters such as texture, asymmetry, border irregularities etc.180 The images are obtained from the affected regions of the skin using the charge coupled camera along with eight narrow band filters ranging from 450 nm to 800 nm at the interval of 50 nm.181 The features are extracted from the image using the principal components analysis. The characterizations of malignant and benign tumors are separated by spatial gray level co-occurrence matrix.182Fig. 13 Multi-modal spectroscopy.

Reprinted from ref. 193 with the permission of AIP publishing.Multispectral imaging technique includes in vivo methods in which the images were analyzed at the wavelength between 483 nm and 950 nm at equal wavelength intervals.183 Multispectral imaging employs the automated diagnosis of skin cancer using the neural network classifier. The neural network has the ability to discriminate the malignant and benign tumor with the sensitivity of 80.4%. In the multispectral imaging system, the pigmented skin lesions are separated by using the automatic segmentation algorithm.184 Usually, in multispectral imaging technique, the images of the skin lesions are analyzed as 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images at the wavelength range from visible to the infrared spectrum.185 Multispectral imaging technique facilitates the analysis of skin lesions, vascular depth and sub-cellular pigmentations.76 It uses the radiometric measurement to analysis the malignant and benign tumors.186 A multispectral imaging technique employs the multispectral camera to capture the skin lesions images. The images are analyzed based on the spectral ranges between 450 nm to 950 nm which is used to discriminate the melanoma from nevus cells.187 The self-developed software is used in multispectral imaging technique to analyze the skin chromophores which is a non-contact method.188 Multispectral imaging method finds its applications in the detection of melanoma skin cancer by considering the parameters such as melanin index and erythema index.189 It also provides the decision of undergoing biopsy from the pigmented lesion using multispectral digital skin lesion analysis (MSDSLA) device.190 Multispectral imaging technique enhances the diagnosis by analyzing the vascular depth of the skin lesion.191 The vascular depth can be interpreted with the help of 6 layered skin models.

This process is referred as thermography. Thermal imager translates the wavelength from the infrared to the wavelength which is visible to human eye as shown in Fig. 14.195 This is the principle which is used to detect the skin cancer using thermography.196 Thermography has been employed in medicine for various applications.197 However, thermography overcomes all the shortcomings that other methods had.Fig. 14 (a) The infrared imaging system, (b) photograph of the body surface area with a cluster of pigmented lesions, (c) reference infrared image of the region at ambient temperature, (d) the same area after cooling and (e) magnified section of the melanoma lesion and surroundings. Reproduced under CC license from ref. 19.A study performed by Cila Herman198 found a significant finding on recently introduced quantitative dynamic infrared system QUAINT which measures differences in the infrared emission between healthy tissue and lesion during the thermal recovery process after removal of cooling stress. Thermistors, thermocouple and other advanced sensors are used to detect the variation in temperature.199 The rise in temperature is a significant symptom in the skin cancer patient. Nano type sensors are involved in detecting the changes in the biological analyses and the obtained information is processed to the local server in the hospital which is directed to the medical professionals in the hospital.200,201 Prateek Mathur et al. studied on temperature variation of thermal images obtained from skin cancer patient and introduced a device named sKan as shown in Fig. 15. It is a new technique which maps the affected area with the help of sensor and monitors the patient's stage in the skin cancer.202,203 This is achieved by having a template of temperature values on which the obtained value is mapped and the data are sent to the doctor for the analysis.201 Viktor Gruev et al. made a report on an imaging sensor capable of recording the optical properties of partially polarized light by monolithically integrating aluminium nanowire optical filters with a CCD imaging array. The imaging sensor consists of 1000 by 1000 imaging elements with 7.4 μm pixel pitch. The polarization imaging sensor captures intensity, angle, and degree of linear polarization in the visible spectrum.204 Current updates on thermography techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are presented in Table 10.Fig. 15 sKan device. This device detects skin cancer using thermal images that are obtained from affected areas of the skin surface using thermistors.

It takes 8 seconds to identify whether it is tumor or normal cell This sensor is used in diagnosing the melanoma during histopathological analysis and also decreases the wrong interpretation Supports shorter range and its performance degrade with longer distances - 213Electrical bio-impedanceThe living cells membrane act as an electrochemical membrane, which is a semi-permeable membrane allows only certain entities to pass through and does not allows the certain size of entities to pass through. The leaky capacitor acts as a semi-permeable membrane. It mainly consists of electrolytes and resistive properties. Biological tissues and cell suspensions have both capacitive and resistive properties. The impedance of biological tissues is highly frequency dependent. They travel in the extracellular due to high capacitance, high-frequency currents. Study of electrical bio-impedance of tumors was done way back in 1980's by Morimoto et al.214,215Electrical impedance tomography (EIT)216 is being used for various biomedical applications. A report given by Beetner D. G. et al. shows the difference in electrical impedance with the frequency range of 1 KHz to 1 MHz for the lesion which has a diameter of 2–15 mm.217 The measurement was done by using electrodes of a two-point measurement.218 The measurement of electrical impedance shows the morphological changes which relate to the growth of skin cancer lesion.219 The multifrequency impedance spectra are used to detect the electrical bio-impedance for different skin lesions.220,221 The non-invasive probe separates the nevi from BCC with 96% sensitivity and 86% specificity.222 The impedance is measured by use of impedance spectrometer between 1 kHz and 1 MHz of various types of skin cancers including melanoma. This improves the signal to noise ratio. By applying small alternating voltage and comparing the measured current with voltage, the impedance between two electrodes is measured.218 The change in impedance is used to detect the skin cancer by using the information about cell shape, structure and orientation, integrity of cell membranes, relative properties of intra and extra-cellular fluids and ionic composition. This device consists of the system on chip impedance converter, AD5933, an ultra-low power MCU, MSP430F6638, and electrodes. The electrode used is Ag/AgCl electrodes, which is non-toxic and low cost.18 A smart phone based early cancer detection using EIT patch electrodes has been demonstrated.223 Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) algorithm is used in detecting the lesions which have high sensitivity in the detection of malignant melanoma.224 Electrical impedance helps in differentiating the cancerous cell from non-cancerous cell at the range of 1 KHz to 2.5 MHz.225 Bio-impedance spectroscopy also available in portable form which is used to monitor the physiological system.226 Latest progress on electrical bio-impedance approaches for skin cancer diagnosis are compiled in Table 11. Fig. 16 shows the different devices used for electrical bio-impedance measurement.Table 11 Recent reports on electrical bio-impedance techniques for skin cancer diagnosisS. no.

Adhesive tape is used to remove the cell layers of the stratum cornea from the skin area. The number of corneocytes and a considerable amount of penetrated formulation will be present in the tape strips.228 Tape stripping is also known as Epidermal Genetic Information Retrieval (EGIR).90 The sample cells from the stratum corneum by the use of adhesive tape stripping from which RNA is isolated, amplified and gene expression is noted.229 This adhesive tape has the RNA genetic expression profile which is useful in differentiating melanoma from nevi.230 With the help of 17-gene genomic biomarker, the presence of melanoma is detected from the harvested specimens. This analysis is carried out using ribonuclease protection assay (RPA). This analysis is used to differentiate malignancies on the basis of gene expression profiles. DermTech's Epidermal Genetic Information Retrieval (EGIRTM) uses a custom adhesives film to collect surface skin samples. This method is painless and it can also be virtually applied to the skin surface. Also, this method has 100% sensitivity and 88% of specificity.231,232 It is a rapid and convenient method233 to contrast various changes in the cancerous patients. It also differentiate lentigo maligna melanoma from solar lentigo, which is sometimes difficult with histology.234 This method is widely used as a robust bedside system for subject with numerous dysplastic nevi.235 Can be performed from the extracted RNA only by freezing it up to −80 °C. Only then the frozen sample is treated.236 Early detection can be achieved if tape stripping toluidine blue (TSTB)237 is combined with ABCDE rule. In 2011, Wachsman and colleagues showed that EGIR performed on 202 melanocytic lesions identified 312 genes that were capable of differentiating normal skin, nevi and melanoma.229 Recent progress on tape stripping techniques for skin cancer diagnosis is compiled in Table 12.Fig. 17 Tape stripping technique.

Interaction of two photons with the same molecule at the same time occurs in two-photon excitation. This two-photon excitation causes fluorescence. Then, the single photon is required to process the fluorescence of right energy to interact with the molecule. Excitation is not produced when the two-photon excitation is used through the specimen, as the photon density is adequately high to cause two-photon absorption. Excitation occurs in the focal spot of the microscope.240 The complete setup is shown in Fig. 18. In particular, two-photon excitation excels at imaging of living cells, especially within intact tissues such as brain slices, embryos, whole organs, and even entire animals. Two-photon excitation microscopy provides great utility for dynamic imaging of living cells in thick specimens, such as intact tissue. The technique does many possible experiments in which conventional imaging cannot be performed.241Fig. 18 Multiphoton scanning technique. In the above image shown setup used two-photon excitation that allows imaging of living tissue up to one millimetre in depth.Researchers like Barry R. Masters, Peter T., C. Enrico Gratton, who worked on multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) demonstrated that the power entering the microscope can be controlled by Glan-Thompson polarizer which reduces power dissipation and increases the efficiency.242 In order to find the difference in accuracy for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) method and multiphoton microscopy, various histological tests were undertaken by Barry et al. and inferred that both methods have similar accuracy.243 However, resolution in terms of three-dimensional gene expressions and depths of tumor are more accurate in MPLSM.244 Later, Timothy P. Padera and colleagues found that epiluminescence property in MPLSM showed the better result in terms of gene expression.245 The major cause of skin cancer is UV rays which makes the skin to lose the collagen and elastin material in the skin are widely affected.246 Morphological altering due to skin aging is investigated by pathological characterization.247 Morphological features in 14 people who are non-melanoma are performed with MPLSM.248 Later 83 person were tested considering the morphological features of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer subjects, which showed a major difference and useful in diagnosis.249 Further to prove the accuracy of both CLSM and MPLCM in differentiating skin layer tumour, Martin Johannes Koehler and his colleagues performed pathological tests.250 MPLSM provides high-resolution fluorescence imaging, allowing visualization of cellular and subcellular structures of the epidermis and upper dermis.251,252 MPLSM based morphologic features of skin cancer images are comparable to traditional histopathology.252 Latest updates on multiphoton scanning for skin cancer diagnosis are summed in Table 13.Table 13 Recent reports on multiphoton laser scanning microscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosisS. no Signal used Description Merits Demerits Acc Ref.1 730 nm and 960 nm Multiphoton excitation microscopy was used to image in vivo human skin auto fluorescence from the surface to a depth of −200 μm Deepest layer of the tissue is observed and displayed in a 3D image Photo damage occurs - 2422 80 MHz at 780 nm Compared the tandem scanning reflected light confocal microscopy and multi-photon excitation microscopy for the observation of human skin in vivo.

The morphologic features observed in MPLSM images of skin tumors are comparable to traditional histopathology Imaging depth is increased here Loss of signal occur during focusing - 252ConclusionThis article briefly summarizes the techniques which deal with the non-invasive approach towards the detection of skin cancer. The different techniques that use various modalities to diagnose the skin cancer are demonstrated with recent updates. However, every system equally shares the advantages and disadvantages in all aspects. We found that the use of TBP surveillance is must in skin lesions and dysplastic nevi which show the result but these results vary according to the experience of the doctor that lead to misinterpretation in some cases while differentiating BCC and melanoma. Also, the age of onset and frequency at which it should be performed remains unclear. This makes limited data to diagnose. Some studies show that there was no evidence in practicing photography as a screening tool in the United States by the dermatologists; instead, they prefer a dermoscopy. A handheld dermoscope is implemented in dermoscopy that provides at least 10-fold magnification of the skin lesions, and almost all primary cares adopt this mode of diagnosing. And no study reported that the survival of melanoma has increased due to dermoscopy evolution. This is mainly due to the same fact that the result varies according to the experience of physician that makes less trust in public towards the clinical screening. As far as the reviews from several abstracts, this could be changed by using a combination of both photography and dermoscopy in heterogeneous aspects that resolves all cons of the conventional techniques and provide an accurate result. The efficiency of the results is based on the usage of algorithms, devices, training and practitioner's experience.Nowadays to avoid false positive results dermatologist use confocal laser scanning microscopy which aid in the assessment of skin lesions by providing high resolution, high sensitivity, high specificity images that are similar to the histopathological images. The only downside of this technique is the high cost that could not be undertaken or affordable by economically backward people. Unlike other techniques, this is unique which is not engaged in comparison with other techniques (dermoscopy) trials to prove the accuracy of results. However, the reported outcomes were mainly focused on the lesion characterizations of CSLM and its test accuracy. Also, imaging modalities like high-frequency sonography, confocal microscopy and OCT have limited availability and are usually found in research units and selected dermatology departments. They are predominantly practiced on an experimental and research basis. Despite their limitations, these high-resolution techniques can give us valuable information on superficial BCC. Nevertheless, awareness of their penetration intricacies must be kept in mind because they may leave cancerous lesions that affect the lower dermis and deeper layers out of their fields of view. Many other modalities like high-frequency ultrasound sonography, PDD, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and THz spectroscopy are still in limited practice in case of skin cancer detection. Techniques like thermography which needs optimum instrumentation for the recording purpose and widely affected by the external noise though it provides a thermogram at high resolution. In case of MPLSM, bio-electrical impedance, OCT, tape stripping, multispectral imaging and fully automated computer-based analysis are considered as investigational that need clinical approval in different usage modalities. Also there are not much evidences or trials undertaken to prove the accuracy with conventional histological determination.Future directionsThe delay of implementing dermoscopy widely in the hospital and other healthcare is due to the lack of training among the physicians. This made an adverse impact in getting such product to the market field. However, usage of higher end resolution camera and instrumentation set up must provide a better result that is indirectly failed to achieve due to insufficient training. Thus proper training, knowledge and experience sharing of practitioners are must for better diagnosis. The use of computer-aided diagnosis in finding the skin lesions could be furtherly enhanced using various pre-processing techniques and segmentation method that would be more informative and satisfying the needs. It is the need for analyzing various attributes and can also be included in dermoscopic techniques so that it is easier to link with computer-aided analysis. The optical methods like OCT and PDD are still under investigation stages; this could be improved by defining the borders of suspicious lesions particularly in non-melanoma skin cancer and the common skin disorders. Further exploration is required in using the laser for detecting melanoma.The features of the future systems should be (i) low cost, (ii) compact and portable, (iii) less diagnosis time, (iv) comfortable (no biopsy), (v) high sensitivity and accuracy. Combination of multiple techniques should be explored for high-quality output and accuracy. Clinicians, researchers and practitioners should step forward towards arriving at a standard protocol and knowledge sharing database, thus help in providing better healthcare relating to skin cancer.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts to declare.AbbreviationsAcc AccuracyBCC Basal cell skin cancerCNN Convolutional neural networkMSOT Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomographyMPT Multi photon tomographyOCT Optical coherence tomographyODT Optical doppler tomographyPDT Photodynamic therapyPAI Photoacoustic imagingPDD Photodynamic diagnosisRCM Reflectance confocal microscopyRes ResolutionSe SensitivitySp SpecificitySCC Squamous cell carcinomaTHz TetrahertzTBP Total body photographyTPI Tetrahertz pulsed imaging",

Historically, the diagnosis of skin cancers has depended on various conventional techniques which are of an invasive manner. A variety of commercial diagnostic tools and auxiliary techniques are available to detect skin cancer. This article explains in detail the principles and approaches involved for non-invasive skin cancer diagnostic methods such as photography, dermoscopy, sonography, confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, terahertz spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, the multispectral imaging technique, thermography, electrical bio-impedance, tape stripping and computer-aided analysis. The characteristics of an ideal screening test are outlined, and the authors pose several points for clinicians and scientists to consider in the evaluation of current and future studies of skin cancer detection and diagnosis. This comprehensive review critically analyses the literature associated with the field and summarises the recent updates along with their merits and demerits.</p><br/><br/><h2 class=\"subtitle\">Introduction</h2><p class=\"section_content\">Skin cancer is a common type of cancer that emerges from the skin. It is extended due to the development of abnormal growth of cells. These cells can invade other parts of the body. More than 90% of cases occur due to the exposure of UV radiation. The UV radiation wavelength ranges from 100 nm to 400 nm. Cancer occurs due to unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells which is caused mostly due to UV radiation. In melanoma, cancer cells arise from moles on the skin which causes inflammation around the epidermal layer which in turn increases the temperature around it.<br/>A survey in 2015 found about 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths occurred due to cancer. As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, considering limited health care resources. Past statistics and trends are shown in Fig. 1. In 2017, out of 5.4 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer, only 3.3 million people were treated in the US. Over 87 110 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the US, but estimation found that 9730 people will die of melanoma due to lack of healthcare resources. About 2 to 4% cases of people are suffering from melanoma skin cancer in India.1 In a report published ten years ago, skin cancer ranked 10th as the most common cancer in Malaysia and accounted for 2.6% of all cancer cases in the country. Melanoma is not very prevalent in Malaysia and occurred in only 5.4% of the patients who attended the dermatology clinic in Hospital Kuala Lumpur, but awareness among them is very less.  At present, between two and three million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132 000 melanoma skin cancers happen globally every year. According to the recent research on skin cancer trends in Asia, it was found that skin cancer rates among the fairer-skinned were approximately three times higher than those who generally have darker complexions. Prevalence rates of skin cancer in Singapore increased from 1968 to 2006, especially among older Chinese.<br/><img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f1.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/><p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 1</b>  shows (a) recent stats and (b) stages of skin cancer. (Data Source: NCI SEER Cancer Stat Facts).</p></p><br/><br/>  <h2 class=\"subtitle\">Classifications of skin cancer</h2><p class=\"section_content\">  Skin cancer is categorized into three types which are basal cell skin cancer, squamous skin cancer and malignant skin cancer. The first two skin cancers are grouped together as non-melanoma skin cancers. The stages of skin cancer is shown in Fig. 1. The features and the treatment involved in each type of cancers are discussed below.</p><h3 class=\"subheading\">Basal cell skin cancer</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> Basal cancer cell (BCC) is the least aggressive of non-melanoma skin cancer derived from keratinocytes that resemble epidermal basal cells. BCC appears like a flesh coloured pearl likes a bump or a pinkish patch of skin. BCC is due to skin exposure especially found in the sun exposed areas such as the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and abdomen. BCC can spread over the body and grows in nerves and bones. BCC is often known as non-melanoma cancer. BCC occurs in at least 2–3 millions of people per year. BCC has low death rate. It can be cured by simple treatment like radiation therapy and tropical medications such as fluorouracil.  </p>  <br/><h3 class=\"subheading\">Squamous cell carcinoma</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> Squamous cancer cell (SCC) is the cancer of keratinocyte cells found on the outer surface of the skin. It appears like a red firm bumps scaly patches. It is caused due to over sun exposure. It is more commonly found in people who have pale light skin. It is mainly found in the regions like ear, face, neck, chest, and back. More than 1 million of people were affected due to SCC and 80[thin space (1/6-em) ]000 people died. In past three decades, there is huge increase in SCC among the US. The death rate of SCC is higher than BCC but comparatively lower than melanoma. BCC and SCC carry the ultraviolet radiation and damage the DNA directly. SCC results in ulceration and ends up with bleeding disorders. It should be treated at the earlier stage else it will grow in the dense amount in the body. SCC is characterized by proliferation of invasive squamous cells which are able to invade other tissues. It can be treated by photodynamic therapy, tropical chemotherapy, and curettage and electrodessication. SCC is the second common cancer in the world. It is not dangerous than that of melanoma.  </p>  <br/><h3 class=\"subheading\">Malignant melanoma</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> Melanoma arises from melanocytes, specialized pigmented cells that are found abundantly in basal layer of epidermis. Malignant melanoma consist of four major histological subtypes frequently reported namely superficial spreading melanoma (70%), nodular melanoma (15%), lentigo maligna melanoma (13%), and acral lentiginous melanoma (2–3%). Melanoma is usually observed as a dark spot on the epidermal (outer) layer of the skin. It is the fast-growing cancer cells that have the ability to spread over the surrounding tissue of the body. The malignant melanoma is caused due to UV radiation and damages the DNA indirectly. The free radical and the reactive oxygen species are the two leading causes of DNA damage. Research indicates that intentness of sunscreen components into the skin, conjugate with 60 min exposure to UV leads to the increase of free radical in the skin. Globally in 2012 malignant melanoma occurred among 232 000 people, and 55 000 people have died. Malignant melanoma is the deadliest cancer, but it can be cured at early stages of cancer. It is normally treated with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy.<br/> Detection of skin cancer in the early stage is useful in treating the condition very quickly. Detection systems pave the way for the diagnosis, but the result was not that precise comparing to biopsy test which is an invasive method. Along with the cost involved, the after-effects of biopsy include severe infectious problem around the punctured area. If the condition found to be more severe in the biopsy test, then surgery is performed, this adds to the cost along with the complexities. Other methods like radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drug therapy can be given, but the loss of hair and sittings often makes the patient to the worst condition. By taking into account all these points, many sensors are fabricated and designed to detect the skin cancer in a non-invasive manner, unlike biopsy.

The change in the property of the reflected light is used for diagnosis. Advanced biochemical markers are also developed with respect to cancerous tissue and specific wavelengths are used to enhance the contrast of the tissue by absorbing light<br/> <b class=\"term\">Photodynamic based.</b> In order to detect the presence of tumor cells, a photosensitive marker is introduced into the particular area. Protoporphyrin IX is formed as a result of chemical reactions inside the body, which is absorbed by the healthy cells but gets accumulated in the tumour cells. When the resectoscope is introduced into the area, under blue illumination the accumulated pigment in the tumour cells emit red fluorescence and normal cells will be in blue. To provide contrast for photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) yellow-light filter is specially designed which enhances the red fluorescence. Skin lesions using photodynamic diagnosis are based on the fluorescent properties of an exogenous and endogenous compound in response to illumination. Stimulation of photosensitizers is made to produce the photodynamic effect when a certain wavelength of light is exposed to it.<br/> <b class=\"term\">Sonography.</b> Sound waves are used in this approach. After transmitting sound pulses into the body, some of the sound waves get reflected back to the probe, while some travel on farther until they arrive another boundary and get reflected. The reflected waves are sensed by the probe and relayed to the machine. The changes in the property of sound waves are used in this technique. Sonography is used to assess skin lesion depth and margins before doing the biopsy and also used to classify adjacent lymph nodes whether it has become cancerous or not. This is added to a patient's protocol to clarify lesion depth, identify margins for excision, and determine lymph node. It has the ability to differentiate benign from malignant skin cancer. It is used to identify metastatic lymph nodes visually, which avoids unnecessary removal of lymph nodes. The main advantage is that it gives the accurate results of measuring skin cancer lesion thickness.<br/> <b class=\"term\">Electrical bio-impedance.</b> The electrical impedance of skin, when measured by topical application of electrodes, is dominated by the high resistance of the stratum corneum. Changes in stratum corneum hydration or structure can be followed by electrical measurements at low frequency. Stratum corneum must be bypassed to measure the living epidermis and dermis. Direct contacts of microneedles on stratum corneum penetrate and measure the electrical activity underlying the skin.<br/> <b class=\"term\">Thermal imaging.</b> Thermography is based on the phenomenon that any object of a temperature above absolute zero emits electromagnetic radiation. There is a definite relationship between the surface of a body and the intensity and spectral composition of its emitted radiation. By determining its radiation intensity, the temperature of an object can thereby be determined in a non-contact way. The human skin is a thermal interface with the human environment. Temperature distribution on the skin will be emitted in the infrared band that is useful in imaging the thermal distribution. Infrared cameras are used in clinical medicine to map the thermal distribution in the human body. Stress is applied to the imaging region so that the liquid crystal plate directly over the body make useful in capturing the image. Thermal imaging can also be performed in a non-contact manner through the infrared camera of high sensitivity. Comparing to other techniques which have false negative reports at a high probability, thermography provides high accuracy.<br/>  </p> <br/><br/> <h2 class=\"subtitle\">Techniques and methods</h2><h3 class=\"subheading\">Photography</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> Total Body Photography (TBP) is also known as mole mapping which is used to identify patients with numerous nevi and changes in the lesions during regular skin examinations.  TBP uses the digital camera for recording and storing the images as shown in Fig. 5. Using a high-resolution, professional medium-format camera, images are taken from the subjects by implementing the camera at different poses and position of the subject to get accurate results. Once the image is taken, it is digitally processed using mirror body mapping software. Sum of all the images is analyzed using this software. The software later generates an interactive, stand-alone program (DermaGraphix) containing the patient's body map. This stand-alone DermaGraphix body map, which is given to the patient using USB 2.0, tier 1 thumb drive. This system can also be performed at home by oneself, but the cost of equipment is high. <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f5.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 5</b>  (a) Illustrates the total body imaging using photographic devices and (b) shows general steps in image processing technique for skin cancer diagnosis. Reproduced under CC license form ref. 43.</p><br/> Lynn T. Dengel, Gina R. Petroni and Craig L. Slingluff et al. had a significant finding of photography method in screening of skin cancer, but it is not used widely used due to time and cost. In this technique, captured the surface images of the skin to identify suspicious and pigmented lesions in high-risk patients primarily. Image processing algorithms are applied to the captured images for detecting any abnormalities in the skin. The segmentation technique which is used to detect the skin lesion is classified as region-based segmentation and neural edge detection. In region-based segmentation method, the optimal threshold is determined iteratively by an isodata algorithm. In neural network edge detection, an approximate closed elastic curve between the recognized neural network edge patterns is fitted. <br/> Computer-aided decision tools are essential in medical imaging for diagnosis and evaluation of various diseases. The acquired image from the subject using high-resolution camera is pre-processed to reduce the artefacts. To overcome the artefacts like the presence of hair in the image, mean, median, Gaussian and anisotropic filters are employed. It is followed by the detection of the lesion by image segmentation technique that partition the image into disjoint areas that are homogeneous concerning a chosen property such as luminance, colour, and texture. Next process is feature extraction.27 The extraction process takes by ABCD rule that checks the symmetrical, border, colour, and the diameter of the acquired image. Once the lesion is localized, different chromatic and morphological features can be quantified and used for classification.28 In the classification part, bringing out the algorithm in the examination process combines visual processing with deep learning. In deep learning, the computer is trained to figure out a problem rather than having the answers programmed into it.<br/> The computer-aided technique is used to segment the melanocytes in the images taken from the skin. This segmentation is made mostly to reduce the local intensity variant. The mean-shift algorithm is adapted. The digital images of melanoma skin lesions can provide information about the skin cancer at an early stage without performing any skin biopsies. The mathematical morphology has been used for segmentation for proper identification of skin lesion area. Using TBP, different shape, texture and colour features are extracted and malignant melanomas have been classified sensitively.32 Delaunay triangulation is a technique used to extract a binary mask of the lesion region, which doesn't require any training. This is highly accurate when dealing with benign lesions, while the segmentation accuracy significantly decreases when melanoma images are processed. Geometrical and colour features were extracted from the binary masks generated by the algorithm for classification, which gives accurate results for melanoma detection. <br/> Computer-aided diagnosis extended its framework for the detection of skin cancer in recent years. The detection of melanoma skin cancer in the early stage will be very useful to cure it and safeguard the life of the affected individuals. Authors Abdul Jaleel, Sibi Salim, R. B. Aswin et al. found that based on imaging techniques and artificial intelligence the result of computer-aided detection of skin cancer is based.34 Computer vision plays a vital role in medical image diagnosis. Reported the computer-aided diagnosis for the pigmentations of skin lesions to determine the presence of skin cancer by performing the boundary detection. Skin lesions can also be analysed by qualification of degree of symmetry. The other paper explains that melanoma can be diagnosed by wavelet and texture analysis. The texture features were derived from the wavelet decomposition and the border features were collected from the lesions borders and the selections of such features were collected by using the gain-ratio method. That was computationally efficient for the melanoma diagnosis. In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis extended its framework in mobile technologies and in cloud platforms. By this method, the system can able to classify the lesions by identifying the moles in skin images and classify them accordingly as melanoma, benign and nevus lesions.37 Computer diagnosis can also be used as a preventive tool in the detection of skin cancer via mobile phone applications. By using this technique, the melanocytes can be separated from the histopathological images. <br/> Smartphone plays an active role in medical diagnostic of skin cancer by considering the sensitivity, specificity etc. The non-clinician users can easily differentiate the malignant and benign tumours. Through the computer-aided method, the patients can identify the skin cancer without going to the hospital. Computer-aided diagnosis can be carried out in the field of image processing, pre-processing, feature extraction, segmentation and classification of demographics images. Computer-aided melanoma diagnosis is used to provide the support to the physicians in enhancing the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of melanoma condition. To capture the images of skin lesions, optoelectronic probe were used. One of the articles reveals that computer-aided diagnosis can be used to detect the early stage of melanoma by applying the image processing technique. Images can be analysed based on ABCD technique which involves asymmetry, border, colour, diameter etc. From the skin lesion images, the above parameters were collected by considering the texture, size and shape of the image. These features were extracted from the images and it was further processed for image segmentation. The extracted features were used to distinguish the normal skin and the melanoma cancer lesions as shown in Fig. 5b. The other methods deal with the image processing in which the images of the affected areas are captured by using the camera of the mobile phone by moving the diffraction grating. Thus the skin cancer can be diagnosed.

Conventional instrumental set up for dermatoscopy includes a magnifier (×10), a non-polarised light source, a transparent plate and a liquid medium between the device and the skin so that skin reflections can be avoided. Modern dermoscope as shown in Fig. 6, do not use this liquid medium; instead, it uses polarised light that eliminates the skin reflection. From this method, the non-cancerous and cancerous condition can be known. Basically, this dermoscope operates under three modes, first is, non-polarised in a contact manner, second is polarised light in a contact manner then the third mode is polarised light in a non-contact manner. The main advantage of using polarized light is, it provides better visualization in deeper skin structures whereas for non-polarized the information will be only on the superficial layer of skin. In this system, the accuracy level is increased based on the experience of the clinician. <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f6.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 6</b> (a) and (b) shows different types of dermoscopes. (a) Reproduced under CC license from ref. 71</p><br/> Dermoscopy shows subsurface structures of the skin with the use of handheld devices that extend optical light ray penetration beyond the skin surface and minimize surface reflection. In contrast, naked eye examination limits visualization of certain skin structures because the stratum corneum has reflective properties. Dermoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis of skin cancer. It has higher discriminating power than a clinical analysis. The report made by Marie-Lise Bafounta, Alain Beauchet, Philippe Aegerter, on the diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer shown that sensitivity and the specificity54 obtained by dermoscopy techniques were comparatively higher than clinical analysis. Skin lesion on the face was usually diagnosed by comparing the dermoscopic features of lentigo senilis and lentigo malinga based on logistic regression method. Dermoscopy plays a crucial role in distinguishing the melanoma cells from benign cells with the help of various diagnostic tools56 such as pattern analysis, ABCD rule, Menzies method, and 7-point checklist. The dermoscopic studies were made on 20 pigmented skin lesions57 based on the pattern analysis and the results were found to be more accurate. Dermoscopy techniques are used to analyze the vascular structure of melanocytic and non-melanocytic tumors based on their morphological behaviour of the skin. Dermoscopy extends its application in early diagnosis of malignant melanoma and differential59 diagnosis of pigmented lesions of the skin by in vivo methods. The study was made on 2522 skin cancer subjects60 based upon the accuracy rate, dermoscopy techniques showed better results than conventional technique, but the main drawback of this technique is that it requires a high-resolution camera to capture the images of skin lesions.<br/> Boundary detection technique which uses gradient vector flow for detecting the boundary is explained. The initialization method is automatic which makes the skin lesion border determination fully automated. The unsupervised approach for skin lesion images based on modified version of JSEG algorithm for detecting the border is used. The border detection error is quantified by a metric which uses manually determined borders by the dermatologist. An approach which is based on detecting the border using statistical region merging algorithm is reported. The border detection error is quantified by a metric which has three sets of dermatologist determined border as the base. This method is compared with four states of automated methods. A new method to detect and visualize the pigment network structures in the images already extracted has been reported. This detection is based on the automatic detection of the edges of pigment network structure which forms cyclic graphs. The extracted image is first pre-processed which gives the binary image; the binary image is then converted into graph and cyclic subgraphs which corresponds to the skin texture. These cyclic subgraphs are filtered to remove round structures. The mobile application uses the image processing technique for the prevention of melanoma. This system comprises of a microscope and a smartphone. The microscope is to image the area of skin, whereas smartphone is to get the output.65 The artefact is removed, and the borders of the lesion are detected by using border detection technique in the captured images. <br/> Dermoscopy also employed in the diagnosis of melanoma condition in pregnant women. The study was made on 35 pregnant women66 and the results showed that the pregnancy leads to significant modifications in pigmented skin lesions. Border detection method was used in dermoscopy techniques to enhance the accuracy level of the diagnosis of skin cancer. Mostly for non-melanoma skin cancer such as SCC and BCC are diagnosed by dermoscopic methods due to its high resolution. Using dermoscopy, the irregular streaks in melanoma can be detected by performing a three-way classification of streaks which involves regular, absent and irregular in a pigmented skin lesions. Esteva et al., employed the deep convolutional neural network to classify melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Latest reports on dermoscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 2.<br/> <p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 2</b> Recent reports on dermoscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/> </p><h3 class=\"subheading\">Ultrasound</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> The ultrasound signal originates from the mechanical oscillations of many crystals in a transducer, which is excited by electrical pulses, this effect is called as the piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric materials are ideal for this. The typical transducer consists of a disk-shaped piezoelectric element that is made vibrating by applying an electrical impulse via an electrode on each side of the disc. Likewise, the echo returning to the disk makes it vibrate, creating a small electrical potential across the same two electrodes that can be amplified and recorded. In modern clinical scanners, the transducer consists of hundreds of small piezoelectric elements arranged in a 1D array packed into a small enclosure. Thus the generated acoustic waves propagate in the fluid or surrounding tissues, from where these structures reflect the echoes which are collected back in the transducer which then transforms into electrical energy. This signal is then processed to get the image of the tumours in a required dimensional form. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), or optoacoustic imaging, is insensitive to photon scattering in the biological tissue and, unlike conventional optical imaging techniques, this technique makes high-resolution optical visualization. <br/> Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an imaging method that produces high-resolution optical images in scattering media, including biological tissues. This technique is also known as functional photoacoustic tomography. MSOT illuminates tissue with light of transient energy, typically light pulses lasting 1–100 nanoseconds. The tissue absorbs the light pulses, and as a result undergoes thermo-elastic expansion, a phenomenon known as the optoacoustic or photoacoustic effect. This expansion gives rise to ultrasound waves (photo echoes) that are detected and formed into an image as shown in Fig. 7. The process is carried out with the help of computer where the image displayed on the screen is useful in diagnosing the lesions.83 The images are obtained in vertical sections are both the resolution and penetration vary according to the frequency. A retrospective study examined the usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound in the diagnosis of BCC through the identification of hyper-sonographic spots. This study concludes the conflicts between hyper-sonographic spots versus hypersonic spots in differentiating BCC and melanoma.<br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f7.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 7</b>  Integrated real-time photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging.</p><br/> Sonography is the pre-operative studies which measures the thickness of the tumor and internal echo density. Ultrasound of B-scan technique is interfaced with the computer which uses 20 MHz frequency transducer in acquiring the image.74 40 MHz ultrasound gives higher resolution than 20 MHz. El Gammal et al. demonstrated the detection of melanoma using 100 MHz frequency which provided higher resolution and detailed visualization of skin layers. High-frequency sonography which is coupled with color Doppler gives 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in detection of melanoma. Ultrasonography is used to produce 3-dimensional imaging and detects the border of the lesions. White light digital photography in combination with reflex transmission imaging, which is a form of high-resolution ultrasound used to classify the pigmented lesions. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is used to study the primary lesion and gives information about the non-surgical treatment. Sonoelastography is used to study the mechanical behaviour of the skin lesions. Melanoma appears as hypoechoic or as heterogeneous oval structure under ultrasound detection. Detailed anatomic data about the primary tumor is provided by sonography.  Retrospective analysis is done by ultrasound for pre-surgical examinations. Fine-needle aspiration cytology is also used as a minimally invasive technique of ultrasound in detecting melanoma. Recent summarization of ultrasound techniques for skin cancer diagnosis is presented in Table 3. <br/><p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 3</b> Recent reports on ultrasound based techniques for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/> </p><h3 class=\"subheading\">Confocal microscopy</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> Confocal microscopy is a non-invasive technique that allows examination of the skin with cellular resolution. It uses a focused laser beam to illuminate a specific point within the skin and measures the reflection of light from that point as shown in Fig. 8. Multiple points are scanned across an area parallel to the skin surface to construct a grayscale image. Different depths can also be imaged to form optical sections. A confocal microscope includes a light source, a condenser, an objective lens and a detector. A confocal microscope uses point illumination and a pinhole in an optically conjugate plane in front of the detector to avoid out-of-focus signal – the name “confocal”.101 This configuration permits the collection of light from the single in-focus plane and dismissal of light from all out-of-focus planes. The light source illuminates a small 3-D spot (voxel) within a sample, such as skin, from which mirrored light is collected to produce a pixel. The illuminated spot is then scanned horizontally over a 2-D grid to obtain a horizontal microscopic section. This process is known as “optical sectioning” of the image in a series of horizontal planes stacked vertically to produce an image pixel by pixel, with an axial thickness of 2–5 μm. This property enables a confocal microscope to look at a slice in the body of a thick semi-transparent sample, whereas, conventional microscopes visualize all the planes contemporarily. <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f8.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 8</b> Confocal microscopy imaging technique.

In vivo RCM is a non-invasive technique that allows examination of the skin with cellular resolution. Resolution is almost comparable to the conventional histology. It has the advantage of allowing the clinician to do a “virtual biopsy” of the skin and obtain diagnostic clues while minimizing unnecessary skin biopsies. <br/>Various skin disorders of which both hyper-pigmentary and hypo-pigmentary lesions can be detected using confocal microscopy. Also in combination with Raman spectroscopy at various wavelength, confocal microscopy provide better cellular details. The recent study involves the usage of vivascope with the extended version which offers better imaging. From 488 to 700 nm, the laser source can be used to illuminate the tissue non-invasively to know the depth nature of tissues and its complications. Multispectral polarized light imaging (MSPLI) and confocal microscopy combination provide better accuracy details in results rather an individual system. Recent progress in confocal microscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis is presented in Table 4. <br/><p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 4</b> Recent updates on confocal microscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/></p><h3 class=\"subheading\">Raman spectroscopy</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> Raman spectroscopy is a technique which is used to discover various modes in a system which involves vibrational, rotational and other low–frequency modes. The detailed setup of Raman spectroscopy is as shown in Fig. 9. It depends on Raman scattering of monochromatic radiations, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared and near UV rays. In Raman scattering, inelastic collisions take place between the photons of an irradiating laser beam and the sample (or tissue) molecules. The obtained spectra can be processed and analyzed in order to provide automated feedback at the time of measurement. This system provides better sensitivity in differentiating the tissues. <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f9.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 9</b>  Raman spectroscopy technique. In image (a) showing hand held probe, (Courtesy of Verisante Technology Inc., Canada; with permission) and (b) showing the Raman spectroscopy mechanism</p><br/>One of the article deals with the classification of skin lesion using Raman spectra by a non-linear neural classifier. The classification model is highly probabilistic and automated. This model involves the feature extraction for Raman spectra and a fully adaptive robust feed-forward neural classifier. The component analysis of Fourier transform Raman spectra of ex vivo basal carcinoma can be diagnosed by using the Nd:Yag laser at the wavelength of 1064 nm acting as an excited source in FT Raman RFS100/s spectrometer. Thirty-nine set of human skin samples were collected. Among the 39 samples, 18 samples were found to be histopathologically diagnosed as non-diseased and 21 samples were found to be BCC. Raman microspectroscopy is mostly done on in vivo method. It is a non-invasive, automated and real-time application to diagnosis the non-melanoma skin cancer which includes both BCC and SCC which can calibrate the sample within less than 1 second. By using the confocal Raman system1 with a handheld probe, the Raman spectra of 21 suspected non-melanoma skin cancers in 19 subjects with matched normal skin spectra were collected to analyse the pathological condition. Small distinctive bands corresponding to specified Raman spectra of lipids and proteins are used to distinguish the skin lesions. Raman Spectra of various compounds can be analysed by using the partial least regression and discriminate analysis. Raman spectroscopy plays a major role in the study of static and dynamic properties of the biologically significant molecule in solution, living cells and cell culture etc. The contribution of various bio-compounds such as lipids and proteins in the tissue can be estimated by providing a linear least square fitting model, to analysis the skin cancer in the tissue regions. Raman spectroscopy can also be used as a developmental tool in medical diagnosis. By shifting the excitation energy of Raman spectroscopy from the visible to NIR regions, the fluorescence components present within the normal cells can be minimized. The software tools have been developed to interpret the spectra of the tissue to diagnose the affected areas of the tissues regions. Cluster analysis plays a significant role in the classification of Raman spectra of malignant tumours from normal cells. Latest updates on Raman spectroscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are summed in Table 5. <br/> <p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 5</b> Recent reports on Raman spectroscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/>  </p><h3 class=\"subheading\">Fluorescence spectroscopy</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> Fluorescence spectroscopy is electromagnetic spectroscopy also known as fluorometry or spectrofluorometry that analyses the fluorescence from the sample. The light source used in this technique excites the electrons in the molecules, and the fluorescence is analyzed from the samples as shown in Fig. 10. This method has been employed in many biological, biochemical and environmental applications. Laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy is used to detect the skin cancer by in vivo methods. <br/> <img src=\"\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 10</b>  Fluorescence spectroscopy. It is used to detect the skin cancer with the help of fluorophores. Reprinted from ref. 145 with permission from Elsevier.</p><br/>A study was conducted by E. Borisova and his team on fluorescence spectroscopy; they noticed that excitation spectrum are usually identical to the absorption spectrum, as the fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the absorption. The non-melanoma skin cancer can be diagnosed by the fluorescence polarization imaging technique, in which the tunable monochromatic light source along with CCD camera is employed to detect the tumour cells. As a result, two fluorophores were retained in tumours. Hyperspectral fluorescence is the one of the technique used to diagnosis the skin cancer in which the two ultrafast lasers were used operating at the wavelength of 355 nm that excites the auto-fluorescence between the bio-molecules that resides in the skin tissue.134 Auto-fluorescence technique is used to capture the images of the pigmented skin lesions, in which both the fluorescence and reflectance were studied.135 The excitation source used in this method is fibre coupled laser operated at the wavelength of 785 nm and the illumination of a light source is filtered by bandpass filter in order to acquire the fluorescence imaging and the reflectance imaging were obtained by the selection of components of the long pass filter. Auto-fluorescence technique is used to select the sampling points for the Raman spectroscopy, based on that the classification of various skin lesions was performed. Fluorescence spectroscopy is used to determine the distribution of biological substances by employing the fluorescent agent.137 The excitation source that causes fluorescence has been integrated with fiber optic probes to examine the tissue and it was recorded by using spectrograph. Fluorescence spectroscopy technique can also be used to classify the benign from malignant tumors with the help of fluorescence spectra by in vivo method. As a result, the normal tissues were found to be the wavelength of 440 nm and the non-melanoma tissues were found to be at the wavelength of 436 nm. Fluorescence spectroscopy has the ability to distinguish the cancerous cells from the non-cancerous cells. The monochromatic radiation is used as an excitation source at the wavelength of 300 nm. From the tissue two sets of fluorescence were emitted at the wavelength of 340 nm and 440 nm. The difference in intensity between the two fluorescence will decide whether the tissue is a malignant or a benign tumour. <br/> PDD of doubtful skin lesions relies on the fluorescent properties of an exogenous drug or endogenous compound in response to a light source. Topical agents are utilized to stimulate the reproduction of endogenous photosensitizers that produce a photodynamic effect when exposed to the light of specific wavelengths and energy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the combination of absorption light and the photosensitizer.141 This technique also helps prior to surgery to detect the cancerous cells by using the photosensitizer. Fluorescence spectroscopy is performed on the tissues by using the photo sensitizer. Non-melanoma skin cancer can be diagnosed by fluorescence spectroscopy by both in vivo and ex vivo method. Auto-fluorescence is used to detect the presence of an abnormality in malignancy. The fluorescence intensity of dermal collagen is generally lower in tumour than in the normal tissues. Synchronous fluorescence method with time-resolved fluorescence technique can also be used for this applications. Modern reports on fluorescence spectroscopy methods for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 6. <p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 6</b> Recent reports on fluorescence spectroscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/>  </p> <h3 class=\"subheading\">Tetrahertz spectroscopy</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> Tetrahertz (THz) spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 11 comes under the spectroscopy technique which is used to detect and controls the properties of matter with the electromagnetic domain that are in the frequency range between a few hundred GHz to several THz. It is an imaging technique, which is used to detect the epithelial cancers. Time domain analysis is used to differentiate between diseased and healthy tissues, which are significant statistically. The location of a tumour is well correlated and increased in terahertz absorption. Diagnosis of skin cancer using frequency domain analysis in terahertz spectroscopy is by using in vitro techniques and by using tetrahertz pulsed imaging (TPI). Then data manipulation is done to determine the spectral information which is related to depth. <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f11.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 11</b> Tetrahertz Spectroscopy. In this technique the properties of matters are probed with short pulses of THz radiations. In the above image (i) showing TPI handheld probe system, (A) main unit with computer monitor, handheld imaging probe and black umbilical cord (visible on the right), (B) close up of the handheld imaging probe, (C) close up of the head of the imaging probe showing the black quartz window. The probe scans an area of 15 × 2 mm, and acquires data from 26 pixels (red), reproduced under CC license from ref. 156; and (ii) showing the THz mechanism, reproduced under CC license from ref. 157.</p><br/>The pulsed THz spectrometry is used to analyse the dielectric properties of the human skin.147 Using this technique, the contrast between the BCC and normal healthy skin was found. The THz material parameter can encounter the dysplastic and non-dysplastic nevi pigmentation and it was compared with the normal healthy skin. A skin tissue model has been developed for the THz wavelength and has been estimated for a Monte Carlo simulation of the polarized light and scattering. The studies were made based upon the Mueller matrices in order to diagnosis the skin cancer. In accordance with the novel optic system, it is used to capture the images of the neoplastic and the non-neoplastic colon tissue with close to the wavelength – limited spatial resolution at the spatial resolution of 584 GHz frequency were employed to study the carcinoma tissues. THz technology plays an important role in medical diagnosis. <br/> T waves also extends its application in both electrical and optical method to diagnose the skin cancer by means of plamonic photoconductive antenna of high sensitivity. THz spectroscopy also used to analyse the biological tissues by integrating the IR camera with IR detector. Using the THz imaging at the range of 1.39–1.63 THz the non-cancerous and cancerous cells can be differentiated. It also extended its application in the domain of biomedical which ranges from the bio-molecules includes lipids, proteins, amino acids to cells and tissues. It is used in sensing applications, involves detection of concealed objects, explosive detection of identifications, space exploration and THz cancer detections. Contemporary updates on THz spectroscopy approaches for skin cancer diagnosis are compiled in Table 7. <br/> <p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 7</b> Recent reports on Tetrahertz spectroscopy for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/></p> <h3 class=\"subheading\">Optical coherence tomography</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> The backscattering of near-infrared light by tissue is measured by the technique called optical coherence tomography (OCT) shown in Fig. 12. OCT is a non-invasive method that allows 2 or 3-dimensional cross-sectional visualization of the microstructural morphology of tissues. It provides better depth resolved image than ultrasound imaging. OCT is an in vivo technique which works on the principle of interference (Michelson interferometry) of infrared radiation and living tissues which is the major reason for high resolution. The interferometer in an OCT scanner splits a broadband source field into a reference field and sample field. The sample field focuses through the scanning optics and the objective lens to some point below the surface of the tissue. The back scattered beam from the tissue combines with the reflected beam from the reference mirror, forming an interference pattern which is detected by the photodetector. Structures of normal skin, including the epidermis, dermo-epidermal junction, dermis, hair follicles, blood vessels and sweat ducts can be clearly visualized by this method. This technique allows the differentiation between the benign and malignant epithelial tissue by the qualitative and quantitative assessment of OCT images. It enables the optical biopsy of epithelial lesions <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f12.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 12</b>  Optical coherence tomography. In the above image (a) showing a hand held OCT device, reproduced under CC license from ref. 176 and (b) showing the OCT mechanism.</p><br/>A report was made by Michael R. Hee, Joseph A. Izatt, Joseph M. Jacobson, James G. Fujimoto, and Eric A. Swanson, who made a significant finding on OCT by introducing a trans-illuminance property in femtosecond laser. Famous authors Alexander M. Sergeev and Valentin M. Gelikonov found that longitudinal scanning of human tissue has good accuracy comparing to transverse scanning. Authors also used CCD camera to detect the photons but failed in showing the wider field of view. Cross-sectional image of human skin is obtained with higher accuracy. It has been proved that longer wavelength can minimize the influence of multiple scattering on image contrast and resolution; thus increase the effective penetration depth of OCT. Combination of both OCT and optical Doppler tomography (ODT) shows better results in scanning speed of acquiring the image. Even for detecting the inflammation on the skin, lesions on the skin and other infection over skin apart from tumour detection can also be performed by OCT. Heterogeneous property of tissue shows that collagen level in tissue can also rate the tumor growth. Later researchers like Aneesh Alex, Jessika Weingast and Martin Weinigel, reported that the combination of multi photon tomography (MPT) and OCT showed better resolution and high penetration depth. To overcome the conflicts in differentiating the non-tumour and tumour, deep margins are detected in the region of interest using the OCT. Increased thermal property of tissue shows various dysfunction of metabolic activity. The epidermal region shows higher thermal coefficient in the cancer patient. Also, the density of normal skin and tumour occurred in the skin varies. OCT reduces the Mohs micrographic surgery. Measurement of epithelial density can also be performed by OCT directly. Currently; precise tumour depth is performed by three methods combination namely, OCT, optoacoustic and Raman spectroscopy which shows the better results. Recent updates on OCT approaches for skin cancer diagnosis are compiled in Table 8. <p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 8</b> Recent reports on OCT techniques for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/>  </p><h3 class=\"subheading\">Multispectral imaging technique</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> In multi-modal spectroscopy (MMS) or multispectral imaging, various linear polarizers of different wavelengths are used. The spectral and spatial information of the samples are simultaneously recorded by the multispectral image spectrometer, in which the acquired images from a monochrome camera is processed using spectral and polarization filtering that provides high contrasting images which is useful in identifying the pathological and morphological features of the suspicious skin lesions. Refer to Fig. 13 shows the multimodal spectroscopy setup for skin cancer diagnosis. The report was made by Hagen Nathan, Kudenov Michael on multispectral imaging based on spectral bands. In this, the image analysis is done automatically and pattern recognition is used to identify lesions which in turns help in further biopsy. It plays an important role in the diagnosis of skin cancer by considering the parameters such as texture, asymmetry, border irregularities etc. The images are obtained from the affected regions of the skin using the charge coupled camera along with eight narrow band filters ranging from 450 nm to 800 nm at the interval of 50 nm. The features are extracted from the image using the principal components analysis. The characterizations of malignant and benign tumors are separated by spatial gray level co-occurrence matrix. <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f13.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 13</b> Multi-modal spectroscopy.

Multispectral imaging employs the automated diagnosis of skin cancer using the neural network classifier. The neural network has the ability to discriminate the malignant and benign tumor with the sensitivity of 80.4%. In the multispectral imaging system, the pigmented skin lesions are separated by using the automatic segmentation algorithm. Usually, in multispectral imaging technique, the images of the skin lesions are analyzed as 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images at the wavelength range from visible to the infrared spectrum. Multispectral imaging technique facilitates the analysis of skin lesions, vascular depth and sub-cellular pigmentations. It uses the radiometric measurement to analysis the malignant and benign tumors. A multispectral imaging technique employs the multispectral camera to capture the skin lesions images. The images are analyzed based on the spectral ranges between 450 nm to 950 nm which is used to discriminate the melanoma from nevus cells. The self-developed software is used in multispectral imaging technique to analyze the skin chromophores which is a non-contact method. Multispectral imaging method finds its applications in the detection of melanoma skin cancer by considering the parameters such as melanin index and erythema index. It also provides the decision of undergoing biopsy from the pigmented lesion using multispectral digital skin lesion analysis (MSDSLA) device. Multispectral imaging technique enhances the diagnosis by analyzing the vascular depth of the skin lesion. The vascular depth can be interpreted with the help of 6 layered skin models. Reported the multispectral imaging techniques combined with 3-dimensional imaging sensor to detect the skin cancer. Contemporary reports on MMS methods for skin cancer diagnosis are summarised in Table 9. <p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 9</b>Recent reports on multispectral imaging technique for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/>  </p><h3 class=\"subheading\">Thermography</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> Infrared radiation is emitted by every object which possesses the temperature absolute zero point. The thermal imager determines the temperature of the object's surface based on the intensity of infrared radiation making it visible to the human eye with the thermal image. This process is referred as thermography. Thermal imager translates the wavelength from the infrared to the wavelength which is visible to human eye as shown in Fig. 14. This is the principle which is used to detect the skin cancer using thermography. Thermography has been employed in medicine for various applications. However, thermography overcomes all the shortcomings that other methods had. <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f14.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 14</b>  (a) The infrared imaging system, (b) photograph of the body surface area with a cluster of pigmented lesions, (c) reference infrared image of the region at ambient temperature, (d) the same area after cooling and (e) magnified section of the melanoma lesion and surroundings. Reproduced under CC license from ref. 19.</p><br/>A study performed by Cila Herman198 found a significant finding on recently introduced quantitative dynamic infrared system QUAINT which measures differences in the infrared emission between healthy tissue and lesion during the thermal recovery process after removal of cooling stress. Thermistors, thermocouple and other advanced sensors are used to detect the variation in temperature. The rise in temperature is a significant symptom in the skin cancer patient. Nano type sensors are involved in detecting the changes in the biological analyses and the obtained information is processed to the local server in the hospital which is directed to the medical professionals in the hospital. Prateek Mathur et al. studied on temperature variation of thermal images obtained from skin cancer patient and introduced a device named sKan as shown in Fig. 15. It is a new technique which maps the affected area with the help of sensor and monitors the patient's stage in the skin cancer. This is achieved by having a template of temperature values on which the obtained value is mapped and the data are sent to the doctor for the analysis. Viktor Gruev et al. made a report on an imaging sensor capable of recording the optical properties of partially polarized light by monolithically integrating aluminium nanowire optical filters with a CCD imaging array. The imaging sensor consists of 1000 by 1000 imaging elements with 7.4 μm pixel pitch. The polarization imaging sensor captures intensity, angle, and degree of linear polarization in the visible spectrum. Current updates on thermography techniques for skin cancer diagnosis are presented in Table 10. <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f15.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 15</b>  sKan device.

The leaky capacitor acts as a semi-permeable membrane. It mainly consists of electrolytes and resistive properties. Biological tissues and cell suspensions have both capacitive and resistive properties. The impedance of biological tissues is highly frequency dependent. They travel in the extracellular due to high capacitance, high-frequency currents. Study of electrical bio-impedance of tumors was done way back in 1980's by Morimoto et al. <br/> Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is being used for various biomedical applications. A report given by Beetner D. G. et al. shows the difference in electrical impedance with the frequency range of 1 KHz to 1 MHz for the lesion which has a diameter of 2–15 mm. The measurement was done by using electrodes of a two-point measurement. The measurement of electrical impedance shows the morphological changes which relate to the growth of skin cancer lesion. The multifrequency impedance spectra are used to detect the electrical bio-impedance for different skin lesions. The non-invasive probe separates the nevi from BCC with 96% sensitivity and 86% specificity. The impedance is measured by use of impedance spectrometer between 1 kHz and 1 MHz of various types of skin cancers including melanoma. This improves the signal to noise ratio. By applying small alternating voltage and comparing the measured current with voltage, the impedance between two electrodes is measured.218 The change in impedance is used to detect the skin cancer by using the information about cell shape, structure and orientation, integrity of cell membranes, relative properties of intra and extra-cellular fluids and ionic composition. This device consists of the system on chip impedance converter, AD5933, an ultra-low power MCU, MSP430F6638, and electrodes. The electrode used is Ag/AgCl electrodes, which is non-toxic and low cost.18 A smart phone based early cancer detection using EIT patch electrodes has been demonstrated. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) algorithm is used in detecting the lesions which have high sensitivity in the detection of malignant melanoma. Electrical impedance helps in differentiating the cancerous cell from non-cancerous cell at the range of 1 KHz to 2.5 MHz. Bio-impedance spectroscopy also available in portable form which is used to monitor the physiological system. Latest progress on electrical bio-impedance approaches for skin cancer diagnosis are compiled in Table 11. Fig. 16 shows the different devices used for electrical bio-impedance measurement. <br/> <p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 11</b>  Recent reports on electrical bio-impedance techniques for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/><img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f16.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 16</b> Electrical bio-impedance measurement setup.

Adhesive tape is used to remove the cell layers of the stratum cornea from the skin area. The number of corneocytes and a considerable amount of penetrated formulation will be present in the tape strips. Tape stripping is also known as Epidermal Genetic Information Retrieval (EGIR). The sample cells from the stratum corneum by the use of adhesive tape stripping from which RNA is isolated, amplified and gene expression is noted. This adhesive tape has the RNA genetic expression profile which is useful in differentiating melanoma from nevi. With the help of 17-gene genomic biomarker, the presence of melanoma is detected from the harvested specimens. This analysis is carried out using ribonuclease protection assay (RPA). This analysis is used to differentiate malignancies on the basis of gene expression profiles. DermTech's Epidermal Genetic Information Retrieval (EGIRTM) uses a custom adhesives film to collect surface skin samples. This method is painless and it can also be virtually applied to the skin surface. Also, this method has 100% sensitivity and 88% of specificity. It is a rapid and convenient method233 to contrast various changes in the cancerous patients. It also differentiate lentigo maligna melanoma from solar lentigo, which is sometimes difficult with histology. This method is widely used as a robust bedside system for subject with numerous dysplastic nevi. Can be performed from the extracted RNA only by freezing it up to −80 °C. Only then the frozen sample is treated. Early detection can be achieved if tape stripping toluidine blue (TSTB) is combined with ABCDE rule. In 2011, Wachsman and colleagues showed that EGIR performed on 202 melanocytic lesions identified 312 genes that were capable of differentiating normal skin, nevi and melanoma. Recent progress on tape stripping techniques for skin cancer diagnosis is compiled in Table 12. <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f17.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 17</b> Tape stripping technique.

The principle of multiphoton scanning is the nonlinear interactions between photons and matter. Interaction of two photons with the same molecule at the same time occurs in two-photon excitation. This two-photon excitation causes fluorescence. Then, the single photon is required to process the fluorescence of right energy to interact with the molecule. Excitation is not produced when the two-photon excitation is used through the specimen, as the photon density is adequately high to cause two-photon absorption. Excitation occurs in the focal spot of the microscope. The complete setup is shown in Fig. 18. In particular, two-photon excitation excels at imaging of living cells, especially within intact tissues such as brain slices, embryos, whole organs, and even entire animals. Two-photon excitation microscopy provides great utility for dynamic imaging of living cells in thick specimens, such as intact tissue. The technique does many possible experiments in which conventional imaging cannot be performed. <br/> <img src=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2018/RA/c8ra04164d/c8ra04164d-f18.gif\" class=\"fig\"> <br/> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Fig. 18</b>  Multiphoton scanning technique. In the above image shown setup used two-photon excitation that allows imaging of living tissue up to one millimetre in depth.</p><br/>Researchers like Barry R. Masters, Peter T., C. Enrico Gratton, who worked on multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) demonstrated that the power entering the microscope can be controlled by Glan-Thompson polarizer which reduces power dissipation and increases the efficiency. In order to find the difference in accuracy for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) method and multiphoton microscopy, various histological tests were undertaken by Barry et al. and inferred that both methods have similar accuracy. However, resolution in terms of three-dimensional gene expressions and depths of tumor are more accurate in MPLSM. Later, Timothy P. Padera and colleagues found that epiluminescence property in MPLSM showed the better result in terms of gene expression. The major cause of skin cancer is UV rays which makes the skin to lose the collagen and elastin material in the skin are widely affected. Morphological altering due to skin aging is investigated by pathological characterization. Morphological features in 14 people who are non-melanoma are performed with MPLSM. Later 83 person were tested considering the morphological features of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer subjects, which showed a major difference and useful in diagnosis. Further to prove the accuracy of both CLSM and MPLCM in differentiating skin layer tumour, Martin Johannes Koehler and his colleagues performed pathological tests. MPLSM provides high-resolution fluorescence imaging, allowing visualization of cellular and subcellular structures of the epidermis and upper dermis. MPLSM based morphologic features of skin cancer images are comparable to traditional histopathology. Latest updates on multiphoton scanning for skin cancer diagnosis are summed in Table 13. <br/> <p class=\"table_description\"><b>Table 13</b> Recent reports on multiphoton laser scanning microscopy techniques for skin cancer diagnosis</p> <br/>  </p> <h2 class=\"subtitle\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"section_content\">This article briefly summarizes the techniques which deal with the non-invasive approach towards the detection of skin cancer. The different techniques that use various modalities to diagnose the skin cancer are demonstrated with recent updates. However, every system equally shares the advantages and disadvantages in all aspects. We found that the use of TBP surveillance is must in skin lesions and dysplastic nevi which show the result but these results vary according to the experience of the doctor that lead to misinterpretation in some cases while differentiating BCC and melanoma. Also, the age of onset and frequency at which it should be performed remains unclear. This makes limited data to diagnose. Some studies show that there was no evidence in practicing photography as a screening tool in the United States by the dermatologists; instead, they prefer a dermoscopy. A handheld dermoscope is implemented in dermoscopy that provides at least 10-fold magnification of the skin lesions, and almost all primary cares adopt this mode of diagnosing. And no study reported that the survival of melanoma has increased due to dermoscopy evolution. This is mainly due to the same fact that the result varies according to the experience of physician that makes less trust in public towards the clinical screening. As far as the reviews from several abstracts, this could be changed by using a combination of both photography and dermoscopy in heterogeneous aspects that resolves all cons of the conventional techniques and provide an accurate result. The efficiency of the results is based on the usage of algorithms, devices, training and practitioner's experience. <br/>Nowadays to avoid false positive results dermatologist use confocal laser scanning microscopy which aid in the assessment of skin lesions by providing high resolution, high sensitivity, high specificity images that are similar to the histopathological images. The only downside of this technique is the high cost that could not be undertaken or affordable by economically backward people. Unlike other techniques, this is unique which is not engaged in comparison with other techniques (dermoscopy) trials to prove the accuracy of results. However, the reported outcomes were mainly focused on the lesion characterizations of CSLM and its test accuracy. Also, imaging modalities like high-frequency sonography, confocal microscopy and OCT have limited availability and are usually found in research units and selected dermatology departments. They are predominantly practiced on an experimental and research basis. Despite their limitations, these high-resolution techniques can give us valuable information on superficial BCC. Nevertheless, awareness of their penetration intricacies must be kept in mind because they may leave cancerous lesions that affect the lower dermis and deeper layers out of their fields of view. Many other modalities like high-frequency ultrasound sonography, PDD, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and THz spectroscopy are still in limited practice in case of skin cancer detection. Techniques like thermography which needs optimum instrumentation for the recording purpose and widely affected by the external noise though it provides a thermogram at high resolution. In case of MPLSM, bio-electrical impedance, OCT, tape stripping, multispectral imaging and fully automated computer-based analysis are considered as investigational that need clinical approval in different usage modalities. Also there are not much evidences or trials undertaken to prove the accuracy with conventional histological determination.<h3 class=\"subheading\">Future directions</h3>  <p class=\"section_content\"> The delay of implementing dermoscopy widely in the hospital and other healthcare is due to the lack of training among the physicians. This made an adverse impact in getting such product to the market field. However, usage of higher end resolution camera and instrumentation set up must provide a better result that is indirectly failed to achieve due to insufficient training. Thus proper training, knowledge and experience sharing of practitioners are must for better diagnosis. The use of computer-aided diagnosis in finding the skin lesions could be furtherly enhanced using various pre-processing techniques and segmentation method that would be more informative and satisfying the needs. It is the need for analyzing various attributes and can also be included in dermoscopic techniques so that it is easier to link with computer-aided analysis. The optical methods like OCT and PDD are still under investigation stages; this could be improved by defining the borders of suspicious lesions particularly in non-melanoma skin cancer and the common skin disorders. Further exploration is required in using the laser for detecting melanoma. <br/> The features of the future systems should be (i) low cost, (ii) compact and portable, (iii) less diagnosis time, (iv) comfortable (no biopsy), (v) high sensitivity and accuracy. Combination of multiple techniques should be explored for high-quality output and accuracy. Clinicians, researchers and practitioners should step forward towards arriving at a standard protocol and knowledge sharing database, thus help in providing better healthcare relating to skin cancer.  </p><br/><br/></p> <h2 class=\"subtitle\">Abbreviations</h2> <p class=\"section_content\">This article briefly summarizes the techniques which deal with the non-invasive approach towards the detection of skin cancer.

Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can then spread to other areas of the body. To learn more about cancer and how it starts and spreads, see What Is Cancer?Melanoma is much less common than some other types of skin cancers. But melanoma is more dangerous because it’s much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.illustration showing cross section of the skin including location of hair follicle, epidermis, dermis and subcutis with details of the epidermis showing squamous cells, melanocyte and basal cellsWhere do skin cancers start?Most skin cancers start in the top layer of skin, called the epidermis. There are 3 main types of cells in this layer:Squamous cells: These are flat cells in the upper (outer) part of the epidermis, which are constantly shed as new ones form.Basal cells: These cells are in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer. These cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off the skin’s surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells.Melanocytes: These are the cells that can become melanoma. They normally make a brown pigment called melanin, which gives the skin its tan or brown color. Melanin protects the deeper layers of the skin from some of the harmful effects of the sun.The epidermis is separated from the deeper layers of skin by the basement membrane. When a skin cancer becomes more advanced, it generally grows through this barrier and into the deeper layers.Melanoma skin cancersMelanoma is a cancer that begins in the melanocytes. Other names for this cancer include malignant melanoma and cutaneous melanoma. Most melanoma cells still make melanin, so melanoma tumors are usually brown or black. But some melanomas do not make melanin and can appear pink, tan, or even white.Melanomas can develop anywhere on the skin, but they are more likely to start on the trunk (chest and back) in men and on the legs in women. The neck and face are other common sites.Having darkly pigmented skin lowers your risk of melanoma at these more common sites, but anyone can get melanoma on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails. Melanomas in these areas make up a much larger portion of melanomas in African Americans than in whites.Melanomas can also form in other parts of your body, such as the eyes, mouth, genitals, and anal area, but these are much less common than melanoma of the skin.Melanoma is much less common than some other types of skin cancer. But melanoma is more dangerous because it’s much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.Other types of skin cancerThere are many other types of skin cancer. Skin cancers that are not melanomas are sometimes grouped as non-melanoma skin cancers because they develop from skin cells other than melanocytes. They tend to behave very differently from melanomas and are often treated with different methods.Basal cell and squamous cell skin cancersBasal cell and squamous cell cancers are by far the most common skin cancers, and actually are more common than any other form of cancer. Because they rarely spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are usually less concerning and are treated differently from melanoma. These cancers are discussed in Basal and Squamous Cell Skin Cancer.Less common skin cancersOther types of non-melanoma skin cancer are much less common than basal and squamous cell cancers and are treated differently. They include:Merkel cell carcinomaKaposi sarcomaCutaneous (skin) lymphomaSkin adnexal tumors (tumors that start in hair follicles or skin glands)Various types of sarcomasTogether, these types account for less than 1% of all skin cancers.Benign skin tumorsMany types of benign (non-cancerous) tumors can develop from different types of skin cells.Benign tumors that start in melanocytesA mole (nevus) is a benign skin tumor that develops from melanocytes. Almost everyone has some moles. Nearly all moles (nevi) are harmless, but having some types can raise your risk of melanoma. See Risk Factors for Melanoma Skin Cancer for more information about moles.A Spitz nevus is a kind of mole that sometimes looks like melanoma. It’s more common in children and teens, but it can also be seen in adults. These tumors are typically benign and don’t spread. But sometimes doctors have trouble telling Spitz nevi from true melanomas, even when looking at them under a microscope. Therefore, they are often removed, just to be safe.Benign tumors that develop from other types of skin cellsSeborrheic keratoses: tan, brown, or black raised spots with a “waxy” textureHemangiomas: benign blood vessel growths, often called strawberry spotsLipomas: soft growths made up of fat cellsWarts: rough-surfaced growths caused by some types of human papilloma virus (HPV)Most of these tumors rarely, if ever, turn into cancers. There are many other kinds of benign skin tumors, but most are not very common.",

            "content": "A risk factor is anything that raises your risk of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking and excess sun exposure, can be changed. Others, like your age or family history, can’t be changed.Having a risk factor, or even many risk factors, does not mean that you will get melanoma. Many people with risk factors never get melanoma. And some people who get it may have few or no known risk factors.Still, it’s important to know about the risk factors for melanoma because there may be things you can do to lower your risk of getting it. If you are at higher risk because of certain factors, there are also things you can do that might help find it early, when it’s likely to be easier to treat.Several risk factors can make a person more likely to develop melanoma.Ultraviolet (UV) light exposureExposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays is a major risk factor for most melanomas. Sunlight is the main source of UV rays. Tanning beds and sun lamps are also sources of UV rays.While UV rays make up only a very small portion of the sun’s rays, they are the main cause of the damaging effects of the sun on the skin. UV rays damage the DNA (genes) inside skin cells. Skin cancers can begin when this damage affects the DNA of genes that control skin cell growth.The pattern and timing of the UV exposure may play a role in melanoma development. For example, melanoma on the trunk (chest and back) and legs has been linked to frequent sunburns (especially in childhood). This might also have something to do with the fact that these areas aren't constantly exposed to UV light. Some evidence suggests that melanomas that start in these areas are different from those that start on the face, neck, and arms, where the sun exposure is more constant. And different from either of these are melanomas on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails (known as acral lentiginous melanomas), or on internal surfaces such as the mouth and vagina (mucosal melanomas), where there has been little or no sun exposure.To learn more about the effects of UV rays on the skin and what you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones, see Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation and How Do I Protect Myself from Ultraviolet (UV) Rays?MolesA mole (also known as a nevus) is a benign (non-cancerous) pigmented tumor. Babies are not usually born with moles; they often begin to appear in children and young adults.Having many moles: Most moles will never cause any problems, but someone who has many moles is more likely to develop melanoma.Atypical moles (dysplastic nevi): These moles look a little like normal moles but also have some features of melanoma. They are often larger than other moles and have an abnormal shape or color. (See Signs and Symptoms of Melanoma Skin Cancer for descriptions of how moles and melanomas look.) They can appear on skin that is exposed to the sun as well as skin that is usually covered, such as on the buttocks or scalp.Dysplastic nevi often run in families. A small percentage of dysplastic nevi may develop into melanomas. But most dysplastic nevi never become cancer, and many melanomas seem to arise without a pre-existing dysplastic nevus.Dysplastic nevus syndrome (atypical mole syndrome): People with this inherited condition have many dysplastic nevi. If at least one close relative has had melanoma, this condition is referred to as familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome, or FAMMM.People with this condition have a very high lifetime risk of melanoma, so they need to have very thorough, regular skin exams by a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin problems). Sometimes full body photos are taken to help the doctor recognize if moles are changing and growing. Many doctors recommend that these patients be taught to do monthly skin self-exams as well.Congenital melanocytic nevi: Moles present at birth are called congenital melanocytic nevi. The lifetime risk of melanoma developing in congenital melanocytic nevi is estimated to be between 0 and 5%, depending on the size of the nevus. People with very large congenital nevi have a higher risk, while the risk is lower for those with small nevi. For example, the risk for melanoma is very low in congenital nevi smaller than the palm of the hand, while those that cover large portions of back and buttocks (“bathing trunk nevi”) have significantly higher risks.Congenital nevi are sometimes removed by surgery so that they don’t have a chance to become cancer. Whether doctors advise removing a congenital nevus depends on several factors including its size, location, and color. Many doctors recommend that congenital nevi that are not removed should be examined regularly by a dermatologist and that the patient should be taught how to do monthly skin self-exams.Again, the chance of any single mole turning into cancer is very low. However, anyone with lots of irregular or large moles has an increased risk for melanoma.Fair skin, freckling, and light hairThe risk of melanoma is much higher for whites than for African Americans. Whites with red or blond hair, blue or green eyes, or fair skin that freckles or burns easily are at increased risk.Family history of melanomaYour risk of melanoma is higher if one or more of your first-degree relatives (parents, brothers, sisters, or children) has had melanoma. Around 10% of all people with melanoma have a family history of the disease.The increased risk might be because of a shared family lifestyle of frequent sun exposure, a family tendency to have fair skin, certain gene changes (mutations) that run in a family, or a combination of these factors.Most experts don’t recommend that people with a family history of melanoma have genetic testing to look for mutations that might increase risk, as it’s not yet clear how helpful this is. Rather, experts advise that they do the following:Have regular skin exams by a dermatologistThoroughly examine their own skin once a monthBe particularly careful about sun protection and avoiding manmade UV rays (such as those from tanning beds)Personal history of melanoma or other skin cancersA person who has already had melanoma has a higher risk of getting melanoma again. People who have had basal or squamous cell skin cancers are also at increased risk of getting melanoma.Having a weakened immune systemA person’s immune system helps fight cancers of the skin and other organs. People with weakened immune systems (from certain diseases or medical treatments) are more likely to develop many types of skin cancer, including melanoma.For example, people who get organ transplants are usually given medicines that weaken their immune system to help prevent them from rejecting the new organ. This increases their risk of melanoma.People infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, often have weakened immune systems and are also at increased risk for melanoma.Being olderMelanoma is more likely to occur in older people, but it is also found in younger people. In fact, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people younger than 30 (especially younger women). Melanoma that runs in families may occur at a younger age.Being maleIn the United States, men have a higher rate of melanoma than women, although this varies by age. Before age 50, the risk is higher for women; after age 50 the risk is higher in men.Xeroderma pigmentosumXeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, inherited condition that affects skin cells’ ability to repair damage to their DNA. People with XP have a high risk of developing melanoma and other skin cancers when they are young, especially on sun-exposed areas of their skin.",

            "content": "Can Melanoma Skin Cancer Be Prevented? There is no sure way to prevent melanoma. Some risk factors such as your age, race, and family history can’t be controlled. But there are things you can do that could lower your risk of getting melanoma and other skin cancers. Limit your exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays The most important way to lower your risk of melanoma is to protect yourself from exposure to UV rays. Practice sun safety when you are outdoors. Seek shade Simply staying in the shade is one of the best ways to limit your UV exposure. “Slip! Slop! Slap!®… and Wrap” If you are going to be in the sun, this catchphrase can help you remember some of the key steps you can take to protect yourself from UV rays: Slip on a shirt. Slop on sunscreen. Slap on a hat. Wrap on sunglasses to protect the eyes and sensitive skin around them. Avoid using tanning beds and sunlamps Many people believe the UV rays of tanning beds are harmless. This is not true. Tanning lamps give off UV rays, which can cause long-term skin damage and can contribute to skin cancer. Tanning bed use has been linked with an increased risk of melanoma, especially if it is started before a person is 30. Most dermatologists (skin doctors) and health organizations recommend not using tanning beds and sun lamps. Protect children from the sun Children need special attention, since they tend to spend more time outdoors and can burn more easily. Parents and other caregivers should protect children from excess sun exposure by using the steps above. Children need to be taught about the dangers of too much sun exposure as they become more independent. To learn more about sun safety For more on how to protect yourself and your family from UV exposure, see How Do I Protect Myself from UV Rays? Watch for abnormal moles Checking your skin regularly may help you spot any new or abnormal moles or other growths and show them to your doctor before they even have a chance to turn into skin cancer. Certain types of moles are more likely to develop into melanoma (see Melanoma Skin Cancer Risk Factors). If you have moles, depending on how they look, your doctor may want to watch them closely with regular exams or may remove some of them if they have features that suggest they might change into a melanoma. Routine removal of many moles is not usually recommended as a way to prevent melanoma. Some melanomas develop from moles, but most do not. If you have many moles, getting careful, routine exams by a dermatologist, along with doing monthly skin self-exams are, might be recommended. If you find a new, unusual, or changing mole, you should have it checked by a doctor experienced in recognizing skin cancers. See Signs and Symptoms of Melanoma Skin Cancer for descriptions of what to look for. Avoid weakening your immune system (when possible) Having a weakened immune system increases your risk of getting melanoma and other types of skin cancer. Infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can weaken the immune system. Avoiding known risk factors for HIV infection, such as intravenous (IV) drug use and having unprotected sex with many partners, might lower your risk of skin cancer and many other types of cancer. (For more information, see HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cancer.) Some people need to take medicines to suppress their immune system. This includes people who have had organ transplants and some people with autoimmune diseases. People with cancer also sometimes need to take medicines such as chemotherapy that can lower their immune function. For these people, the benefit from taking these medicines will likely far outweigh the small increased risk of getting skin cancer.",

Avoiding known risk factors for HIV infection, such as intravenous (IV) drug use and having unprotected sex with many partners, might lower your risk of skin cancer and many other types of cancer. (For more information, see HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cancer.)</p> <p class=\"section_content\">Some people need to take medicines to suppress their immune system. This includes people who have had organ transplants and some people with autoimmune diseases. People with cancer also sometimes need to take medicines such as chemotherapy that can lower their immune function. For these people, the benefit from taking these medicines will likely far outweigh the small increased risk of getting skin cancer.</p>"

This is to try to lower the chance that the cancer will come back.Radiation can be used to treat melanoma that has come back after surgery, either in the skin or lymph nodes, or to help treat distant spread of the disease.Radiation therapy is often used to relieve symptoms caused by the spread of the melanoma, especially to the brain or bones. Treatment with the goal of relieving symptoms is called palliative therapy. Palliative radiation therapy is not expected to cure the cancer, but it might help shrink it or slow its growth for a time to help control some of the symptoms.How is radiation therapy given?The type of radiation most often used to treat melanoma, known as external beam radiation therapy, focuses radiation from a source outside of the body on the cancer.The treatment schedule can vary based on the goal of treatment and where the melanoma is. Before treatments start, your radiation team will take careful measurements to find the correct angles for aiming the radiation beams and the proper dose of radiation. This planning session is called simulation.Treatment is much like getting an x-ray, but the radiation is stronger. The procedure itself is painless. Each treatment lasts only a few minutes, although the setup time – getting you into place for treatment – usually takes longer.Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)SRS is a type of radiation therapy that can sometimes be used for tumors that have spread to the brain. (Despite the name, there is no actual surgery.) High doses of radiation are aimed precisely at the tumor(s) in one or more treatment sessions. There are 2 main ways to give SRS:In one version, a machine called a Gamma Knife® focuses about 200 thin beams of radiation on the tumor from different angles over a few minutes to hours. The head is kept in the same position by placing it in a rigid frame.In another version, a linear accelerator (a machine that creates radiation) that is controlled by a computer moves around the head to deliver radiation to the tumor from many different angles over a few minutes. The head is kept in place with a head frame or a plastic face mask.These treatments can be repeated if needed.Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)This approach is similar to SRS (using a linear accelerator), but it can be used to treat tumors in other parts of the body.Possible side effects of radiation therapySide effects of radiation are usually limited to the area getting radiation. Common side effects can include:Sunburn-like skin problemsChanges in skin colorHair loss where the radiation enters the bodyFatigueNausea (if radiation is aimed at the abdomen)Often these go away after treatment.Radiation therapy to the brain can sometimes cause memory loss, headaches, trouble thinking, or reduced sexual desire. Usually these symptoms are minor compared with those caused by a tumor in the brain, but they might still affect your quality of life.More information about radiation therapyTo learn more about how radiation is used to treat cancer, see Radiation Therapy.To learn about some of the side effects listed here and how to manage them, see Managing Cancer-related Side Effects.",

            "content": "Chemotherapy (chemo) uses drugs that kill cancer cells. The drugs are usually injected into a vein or taken by mouth as a pill. They travel through the bloodstream to all parts of the body and attack cancer cells that have already spread beyond the skin.When might chemo be used?Chemo might be used to treat advanced melanoma after other treatments have been tried, but it’s not often used as the first treatment because newer forms of immunotherapy and targeted drugs are typically more effective. Chemo is usually not as helpful for melanoma as it is for some other types of cancer, but it can shrink tumors in some people.Which chemo drugs are used to treat melanoma?Several chemo drugs can be used to treat melanoma:Dacarbazine (also called DTIC)TemozolomideNab-paclitaxelPaclitaxelCisplatinCarboplatinSome of these drugs are given alone, while others are more often combined with other drugs. It’s not clear if using combinations of drugs is more helpful than using a single drug, but it can add to the side effects.Doctors give chemo in cycles, with each period of treatment followed by a rest period to give the body time to recover. Each chemo cycle typically lasts for a few weeks.Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) and isolated limb infusion (ILI): These are ways of giving chemotherapy that are sometimes used to treat melanoma that is confined to an arm or leg but that can't be removed with surgery. The idea with this approach is to keep the chemo in the limb and not allow it to reach other parts of the body, where it could cause more side effects.This is done during a surgical procedure. The blood flow of the arm or leg is separated from the rest of the body, and a high dose of chemotherapy is circulated through the limb for a short period of time. This lets doctors give high doses to the area of the tumor without exposing other parts of the body to these doses.To do this, a tube is placed into the artery that feeds blood into the limb, and a second tube is placed into the vein that drains blood from it.For ILP, the artery and vein are first surgically separated from the circulation to the rest of the body, and are then hooked up to tubes going to a special machine in the operating room.For ILI, long tubes (catheters) are inserted through the skin and into the artery and vein. This method is less complex and takes less time, and it might not require general anesthesia (where you are in a deep sleep).In either case, a tourniquet is tied around the limb to help make sure the chemo doesn’t enter the rest of the body. Chemotherapy (usually with a drug called melphalan) is infused into the blood in the limb through the artery. (This is done by the machine in ILP, and by using a syringe in ILI.) During the treatment session, the blood exits the limb through the tube in the vein, the chemo is added, and then the blood is returned back to the limb through the tube in the artery. (During ILP, the drug can also be heated by the machine to help the chemo work better.) By the end of the treatment the drug is washed out of the limb, and the tubes are removed (and for ILP the blood vessels are stitched back together) so that the circulation is returned to normal.Possible side effects of chemotherapyChemo drugs can cause side effects. These depend on the type and dose of drugs given and how long they are used. The side effects of chemo can include:Hair lossMouth soresLoss of appetiteNausea and vomitingDiarrhea or constipationIncreased risk of infection (from having too few white blood cells)Easy bruising or bleeding (from having too few blood platelets)Fatigue (from having too few red blood cells)These side effects usually go away once treatment is finished. There are often ways to lessen side effects. For example, drugs can help prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting. Be sure to ask your doctor or nurse about drugs to help reduce side effects.Some chemo drugs can have other side effects. For example, some drugs can damage nerves, which can lead to symptoms (mainly in the hands and feet) such as pain, burning or tingling sensations, sensitivity to cold or heat, or weakness. This condition is called peripheral neuropathy. It usually goes away once treatment is stopped, but for some people it can last a long time.Be sure to talk with your cancer care team about what to expect in terms of side effects. While you are getting chemo, report any side effects to your medical team so that they can be treated promptly. In some cases, the doses of chemo may need to be reduced or treatment may need to be delayed or stopped to prevent side effects from getting worse.",

Targeted drugs work differently from standard chemotherapy drugs, which basically attack any quickly dividing cells.Targeted drugs can be very helpful in treating melanomas that have certain gene changes.Drugs that target cells with BRAF gene changesAbout half of all melanomas have changes (mutations) in the BRAF gene. Melanoma cells with these changes make an altered BRAF protein that helps them grow. Some drugs target this and related proteins, such as the MEK proteins.If you have melanoma that has spread beyond the skin, a biopsy sample of it will likely be tested to see if the cancer cells have a BRAF mutation. Drugs that target the BRAF protein (BRAF inhibitors) or the MEK proteins (MEK inhibitors) aren’t likely to work on melanomas that have a normal BRAF gene.Most often, if a person has a BRAF mutation and needs targeted therapy, they will get both a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor, as combining these drugs often works better than either one alone.BRAF inhibitorsVemurafenib (Zelboraf), dabrafenib (Tafinlar), and encorafenib (Braftovi) are drugs that attack the BRAF protein directly.These drugs can shrink or slow the growth of tumors in some people whose melanoma has spread or can’t be removed completely.Dabrafenib can also be used (along with the MEK inhibitor trametinib; see below) after surgery in people with stage III melanoma, where it can help lower the risk of the cancer coming back.These drugs are taken as pills or capsules, once or twice a day.Common side effects can include skin thickening, rash, itching, sensitivity to the sun, headache, fever, joint pain, fatigue, hair loss, and nausea. Less common but serious side effects can include heart rhythm problems, liver problems, kidney failure, severe allergic reactions, severe skin or eye problems, bleeding, and increased blood sugar levels.Some people treated with these drugs develop new squamous cell skin cancers. These cancers are usually less serious than melanoma and can be treated by removing them. Still, your doctor will want to check your skin often during treatment and for several months afterward. You should also let your doctor know right away if you notice any new growths or abnormal areas on your skin.MEK inhibitorsThe MEK gene works together with the BRAF gene, so drugs that block MEK proteins can also help treat melanomas with BRAF gene changes. MEK inhibitors include trametinib (Mekinist), cobimetinib (Cotellic), and binimetinib (Mektovi).These drugs can be used to treat melanoma that has spread or can’t be removed completely.Trametinib can also be used along with dabrafenib after surgery in people with stage III melanoma, where it can help lower the risk of the cancer coming back.Again, the most common approach is to combine a MEK inhibitor with a BRAF inhibitor. This seems to shrink tumors for longer periods of time than using either type of drug alone. Some side effects (such as the development of other skin cancers) are actually less common with the combination.MEK inhibitors are pills taken once or twice a day.Common side effects can include rash, nausea, diarrhea, swelling, and sensitivity to sunlight. Rare but serious side effects can include heart lung, or liver damage; bleeding or blood clots; vision problems; muscle damage; and skin infections.Drugs that target cells with C-KIT gene changesA small portion of melanomas have changes in the C-KIT gene that help them grow. These changes are more common in melanomas that start in certain parts of the body:On the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails (known as acral melanomas)Inside the mouth or other mucosal (wet) areasIn areas that get chronic sun exposureSome targeted drugs, such as imatinib (Gleevec) and nilotinib (Tasigna), can affect cells with changes in C-KIT. If you have an advanced melanoma that started in one of these places, your doctor may test your melanoma cells for changes in the C-KIT gene, which might mean that one of these drugs could be helpful.Drugs that target different gene changes are also being studied in clinical trials (see What’s New in Melanoma Skin Cancer Research?).More information about targeted therapyTo learn more about how targeted drugs are used to treat cancer, see Targeted Cancer Therapy.To learn about some of the side effects listed here and how to manage them, see Managing Cancer-related Side Effects.",

Several types of immunotherapy can be used to treat melanoma.Immune checkpoint inhibitorsAn important part of the immune system is its ability to keep itself from attacking normal cells in the body. To do this, it uses “checkpoints,” which are proteins on immune cells that need to be turned on (or off) to start an immune response. Melanoma cells sometimes use these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. But these drugs target the checkpoint proteins, helping to restore the immune response against melanoma cells.PD-1 inhibitorsPembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo) are drugs that target PD-1, a protein on immune system cells called T cells that normally help keep these cells from attacking other cells in the body. By blocking PD-1, these drugs boost the immune response against melanoma cells. This can often shrink tumors and help people live longer.They can be used to treat melanomas:That can’t be removed by surgeryThat have spread to other parts of the bodyAfter surgery (as adjuvant treatment) for certain stage II or III melanomas to try to lower the risk of the cancer coming backThese drugs are given as an intravenous (IV) infusion, typically every 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the drug and why it's being given.PD-L1 inhibitorAtezolizumab (Tecentriq) is a drug that targets PD-L1, a protein related to PD-1 that is found on some tumor cells and immune cells. Blocking this protein can help boost the immune response against melanoma cells.This drug can be used along with cobimetinib and vemurafenib in people with melanoma that has the BRAF gene mutation, when the cancer can’t be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.This drug is given as an intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 to 4 weeks.CTLA-4 inhibitorIpilimumab (Yervoy) is another drug that boosts the immune response, but it has a different target. It blocks CTLA-4, another protein on T cells that normally helps keep them in check.It can be used to treat melanomas that can’t be removed by surgery or that have spread to other parts of the body. It might also be used for less advanced melanomas after surgery (as an adjuvant treatment) in some situations, to try to lower the risk of the cancer coming back.When used alone, this drug doesn’t seem to shrink as many tumors as the PD-1 inhibitors, and it tends to have more serious side effects, so usually one of those other drugs is used first. Another option in some situations might be to combine this drug with one of the PD-1 inhibitors. This can increase the chance of shrinking the tumors (slightly more than a PD-1 inhibitor alone), but it can also increase the risk of side effects.This drug is given as an intravenous (IV) infusion, usually once every 3 weeks for 4 treatments (although it may be given for longer when used as an adjuvant treatment).LAG-3 inhibitorRelatlimab targets LAG-3, another checkpoint protein on certain immune cells that normally helps keep the immune system in check.This drug is given along with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (in a combination known as Opdualag). It can be used to treat melanomas that can’t be removed by surgery or that have spread to other parts of the body.This drug is given as an intravenous (IV) infusion, typically once every 4 weeks.Possible side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitorsSome of the more common side effects of these drugs can include fatigue, cough, nausea, skin rash, poor appetite, constipation, joint pain, and diarrhea.Other, more serious side effects occur less often.Infusion reactions: Some people might have an infusion reaction while getting these drugs. This is like an allergic reaction, and can include fever, chills, flushing of the face, rash, itchy skin, feeling dizzy, wheezing, and trouble breathing. It’s important to tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of these symptoms while getting these drugs.Autoimmune reactions: These drugs remove one of the safeguards on the body's immune system. Sometimes the immune system responds by attacking other parts of the body, which can cause serious or even life-threatening problems in the lungs, intestines, liver, hormone-making glands, kidneys, or other organs.It’s very important to report any new side effects to someone on your health care team as soon as possible. If serious side effects do occur, treatment may need to be stopped and you might be given high doses of corticosteroids to suppress your immune system.Interleukin-2 (IL-2)Interleukins are proteins that certain cells in the body make to boost the immune system in a general way. Lab-made versions of interleukin-2 (IL-2) are sometimes used to treat melanoma. They are given as intravenous (IV) infusions, at least at first. Some patients or caregivers may be able to learn how to give injections under the skin at home.For advanced melanomas: IL-2 can sometimes shrink advanced melanomas when used alone. It is not used as much as in the past, because the immune checkpoint inhibitors are more likely to help people and tend to have fewer side effects. But IL-2 might be an option if these drugs are no longer working.Side effects of IL-2 can include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, aches, severe tiredness, drowsiness, and low blood cell counts. In high doses, IL-2 can cause fluid to build up in the body so that the person swells up and can feel quite sick. Because of this and other possible serious side effects, high-dose IL-2 is given only in the hospital, in centers that have experience with this type of treatment.For some earlier-stage melanomas: Melanomas that have reached the nearby lymph nodes are more likely to come back in another part of the body, even if all of the cancer is thought to have been removed. IL-2 can sometimes be injected into the tumors (known as intralesional therapy) to try to prevent this. Side effects are similar but tend to be milder when IL-2 is injected directly into the tumor.When deciding whether to use IL-2, patients and their doctors need to take into account the potential benefits and side effects of this treatment.Oncolytic virus therapyViruses are a type of germ that can infect and kill cells. Some viruses can be altered in the lab so that they infect and kill mainly cancer cells. These are known as oncolytic viruses. Along with killing the cells directly, the viruses can also alert the immune system to attack the cancer cells.Talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic), also known as T-VEC, is an oncolytic virus that can be used to treat melanomas in the skin or lymph nodes that can’t be removed with surgery. The virus is injected directly into the tumors, typically every 2 weeks. This treatment can sometimes shrink these tumors, and might also shrink tumors in other parts of the body.Side effects can include flu-like symptoms and pain at the injection site.Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccineBCG is a germ related to the one that causes tuberculosis. BCG doesn’t cause serious disease in humans, but it does activate the immune system. The BCG vaccine can be used to help treat stage III melanomas by injecting it directly into tumors, although it isn't used very often.Imiquimod creamImiquimod (Zyclara) is a drug that is put on the skin as a cream. It stimulates a local immune response against skin cancer cells. For very early (stage 0) melanomas in sensitive areas on the face, some doctors may use imiquimod if surgery might be disfiguring. It might also be an option for some melanomas that have spread along the skin.The cream is usually applied 2 to 5 times a week for around 3 months. Some people have serious skin reactions to this drug. Imiquimod is not used for more advanced melanomas.Newer treatmentsSome other types of immunotherapy have shown promise in treating melanoma in early studies. Other studies are now looking at combining different types of immunotherapy to see if it might help them work better.

            "content": "Surgery is the main treatment option for most melanomas, and usually cures early-stage melanomas.Wide excisionWhen melanoma is diagnosed by skin biopsy, more surgery will probably be needed to help make sure the cancer has been removed (excised) completely. This fairly minor operation will cure most thin melanomas.Local anesthesia is injected into the area to numb it before the excision. The site of the tumor is then cut out, along with a small amount of normal skin around the edges (called the margin). The wound is usually stitched back together afterward. This will leave a scar.The removed sample is then viewed with a microscope to make sure that no cancer cells were left behind at the edges of the skin that was removed.Wide excision differs from an excisional biopsy. The margins are wider because the diagnosis is already known. The recommended margins vary depending on the thickness of the tumor. Thicker tumors need larger margins (both at the edges and in the depth of the excision).The margins can also vary based on where the melanoma is on the body and other factors. For example, if the melanoma is on the face, the margins may be smaller to avoid large scars or other problems. Smaller margins might increase the risk of the cancer coming back, so be sure to discuss the options with your doctor.Mohs surgeryIn some situations, Mohs surgery (also known as Mohs micrographic surgery, or MMS) might be an option. This type of surgery is used more often for some other types of skin cancer, but not all doctors agree on using it for melanoma.Mohs surgery is done by a specially trained dermatologist or surgeon. In this procedure, the skin (including the melanoma) is removed in very thin layers. Each layer is then looked at with a microscope. If cancer cells are seen, the doctor removes another layer of skin. This is repeated until a layer shows no signs of cancer. This is a slow process, often taking several hours, but it means that more normal skin near the tumor can be saved, which can help the area look better after surgery.AmputationIn uncommon situations where the melanoma is on a finger or toe and has grown deeply, part or all of that digit might need to be amputated.Lymph node dissectionIn this operation, the surgeon removes all of the lymph nodes in the region near the primary melanoma tumor. For example, if the melanoma is on a leg, the surgeon would remove the nodes in the groin region on that side of the body, which is where melanoma cells would most likely travel to first.Once the diagnosis of melanoma is made from the skin biopsy, the doctor will examine the lymph nodes near the melanoma. Depending on the thickness and location of the melanoma, this may be done by physical exam, or by imaging tests (such as ultrasound or CT or PET scans) to look at nodes that are not near the body surface.If the nearby lymph nodes are abnormally hard or large, and a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy or excisional biopsy finds melanoma in a node or nodes, a lymph node dissection is usually done.If the lymph nodes are not enlarged, a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done, particularly if the melanoma is thicker than 1 mm. (See Tests for Melanoma Skin Cancer for a description of this procedure.) If the sentinel lymph node does not contain cancer, then there is no need for a lymph node dissection because it’s unlikely the melanoma has spread to the lymph nodes. If the sentinel lymph node contains cancer cells, removing the remaining lymph nodes in that area with a lymph node dissection is usually advised. This is called a completion lymph node dissection.It’s not clear if a lymph node dissection can cure melanomas that have spread to the nodes. This is still being studied. Still, some doctors feel it might prolong a patient’s life and at least avoid the pain that may be caused by cancer growing in these lymph nodes.A full lymph node dissection can cause some long-term side effects. One of the most troublesome can be lymphedema. Lymph nodes in the groin or under the arm normally help drain fluid from the limbs. If they are removed, fluid may build up. This can cause limb swelling, which may or may not go away. If severe enough, it can cause skin problems and an increased risk of infections in the limb. Elastic stockings or compression sleeves can help some people with this condition. For more information, see Lymphedema.Lymphedema, along with the pain from the surgery itself, is a main reason why lymph node dissection is not done unless the doctor feels it is really necessary. Sentinel lymph node biopsy, however, is unlikely to have this effect. It’s important to discuss the risks of side effects with your doctor before having either of these procedures.Surgery for metastatic melanomaIf melanoma has spread (metastasized) from the skin to other organs such as the lungs or brain, the cancer is very unlikely to be curable by surgery. Even when only 1 or 2 areas of spread are found by imaging tests such as CT or MRI scans, there are likely to be others that are too small to be found by these scans.Surgery is sometimes done in these circumstances, but the goal is usually to try to control the cancer rather than to cure it. If 1 or even a few metastases are present and can be removed completely, this surgery may help some people live longer. Removing metastases in some places, such as the brain, might also help prevent or relieve symptoms and improve a person’s quality of life.If you have metastatic melanoma and your doctor suggests surgery as a treatment option, be sure you understand what the goal of the surgery would be, as well as its possible benefits and risks.",

Whether your cancer is gone, or you need to continuetreatment, you likely have some concerns.During and after treatmentYour doctor will want to watch youclosely, whether you have finishedtreatment or not. They will want tomake sure you are getting better andthat the cancer has not come back.Also, your risk for getting a new skincancer on a different part of your bodyis high. So be sure to continue to seeyour doctor.Be sure to:• Ask your doctor how often you need to be seen.• Ask if you will need tests to look for other cancers or check for problems from your treatment.• Ask for a list of late- or long-term side effects you should watch for.• Ask what to watch for and when you should contact your doctor.• Tell your doctor or other people on yourhealth care team about any symptoms youhave so they can help you manage them.• Ask for a copy of important medicalrecords and a plan for care after treatment.Staying healthyYou can do a lot to keep yourself healthyduring and after treatment for skincancer. Eating well, being active, andstaying at a healthy weight can help youfeel better.

            "html_content": "<p>Learning to live with cancer can be stressful. Whether your cancer is gone, or you need to continue treatment, you likely have some concerns.</p> <h4>During and after treatment</h4> <p>Your doctor will want to watch you closely, whether you have finished treatment or not. They will want to make sure you are getting better and that the cancer has not come back. Also, your risk for getting a new skin cancer on a different part of your body is high. So be sure to continue to see your doctor.</p> <p><b>Be sure to:</b></p> <ul> <li>Ask your doctor how often you need to be seen.</li> <li>Ask if you will need tests to look for other cancers or check for problems from your treatment.</li> <li>Ask for a list of late- or long-term side effects you should watch for.</li> <li>Ask what to watch for and when you should contact your doctor.</li> <li>Tell your doctor or other people on your health care team about any symptoms you have so they can help you manage them.</li> <li>Ask for a copy of important medical records and a plan for care after treatment.</li> </ul> <h4>Staying healthy</h4> <p>You can do a lot to keep yourself healthy during and after treatment for skin cancer. Eating well, being active, and staying at a healthy weight can help you feel better. Healthy behaviors might also lower your risk of getting other cancers. There are things you can do to help lower your risk of getting a new skin cancer or catch a new one early:</p> <ul> <li>Protect yourself from getting too much sun.</li> <li>Do not use tobacco products.

Remember to get screened for other kinds of cancers and health problems.</li> </ul> <h4>Dealing with feelings</h4> <p>Having cancer might make you feel scared, sad, or nervous. These feelings are normal. And there are ways to help you cope with them.</p> <ul> <li>Don’t try to deal with your feelings all by yourself.</li> <li>Talk about your feelings, no matter what they are.</li> <li>It’s OK to feel sad or down once in a while. Let someone know if you’re feeling unhappy for more than a few days in a row.</li> <li>Stay active and keep up healthy habits.</li> <li>Do things you enjoy, like taking a hot bath or a nap or eating your favorite foods.</li> <li>Go to a movie, out to dinner, or to a sporting event, if your doctor says it’s OK.</li> <li>Get help with tasks like cooking and cleaning.</li> </ul> <p>Think about asking for help and support from other people. You might want to reach out to friends and family or to religious leaders or groups. Some people find it helpful to talk with others who’ve been through the same things. A support group can offer that. And some people are helped by getting one-on-one counseling. Tell your health care team how you are feeling. They can help you find the right support.</p>"

            "content": "For many people with melanoma, treatment can remove or destroy the cancer. Completing treatment can be both stressful and exciting. You may be relieved to finish treatment, but find it hard not to worry about cancer growing or coming back. (When cancer comes back after treatment, it is called recurrent cancer or a recurrence.) This is very common if you’ve had cancer.For some people, the melanoma may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatment with immunotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy, or other treatments to try to help keep the cancer under control for as long as possible. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty.Follow-up after melanomaEven if you’ve completed treatment, your doctors will still want to watch you closely. Along with the risk of the melanoma coming back, people who have had melanoma have a high risk of developing another one, so it’s very important to keep all follow-up appointments. During these visits, your doctors will ask about any problems you are having and may do exams and lab tests or imaging tests to look for signs of cancer or treatment side effects.Some treatment side effects might last a long time or might not even show up until years after you have finished treatment. Your doctor visits are a good time to ask questions and talk about any changes or problems you notice or concerns you have.Exams and testsYour follow-up schedule should include regular skin and lymph node exams by yourself and by your doctor. How often you need follow-up doctor visits depends on the stage of your melanoma when you were diagnosed and other factors. In addition to the exams, imaging tests such as ultrasounds or CT scans may be recommended for some people.A typical follow-up schedule for people with early-stage melanomas that were removed completely might call for physical exams every 6 to 12 months for several years. If these exams are normal, the time between your doctor visits may be extended. Your doctor may recommend more frequent exams if you have many moles or atypical moles.For thicker melanomas or those that had spread beyond the skin, a typical schedule might include physical exams every 3 to 6 months for several years. After that, exams might be done less often. Imaging tests such as ultrasounds or CT scans might be done as well, especially for people who had more advanced stage disease.It’s also important for melanoma survivors to do regular self-exams of their skin and lymph nodes. Most doctors recommend this at least monthly. You should see your doctor if you find any new lump or change in your skin. You should also report any new symptoms (for example, pain, cough, fatigue, loss of appetite) that don’t go away. Melanoma can sometimes come back many years after it was first treated.People with melanoma that doesn’t go away completely with treatment will have a follow-up schedule that is based on their specific situation.Ask your doctor for a survivorship care planTalk with your doctor about developing a survivorship care plan for you. This plan might include:A suggested schedule for follow-up exams and testsA schedule for other tests you might need in the future, such as early detection (screening) tests for other types of cancer, or tests to look for long-term health effects from your cancer or its treatmentA list of possible late- or long-term side effects from your treatment, including what to watch for and when you should contact your doctorDiet and physical activity suggestionsKeeping health insurance and copies of your medical recordsEven after treatment, it’s very important to keep health insurance. Tests and doctor visits cost a lot, and even though no one wants to think of their cancer coming back, this could happen.At some point after your cancer treatment, you might find yourself seeing a new doctor who doesn’t know about your medical history. It’s important to keep copies of your medical records to give your new doctor the details of your diagnosis and treatment. Learn more in Keeping Copies of Important Medical Records.Can I lower my risk of the melanoma progressing or coming back?If you have (or have had) melanoma, you probably want to know if there are things you can do that might lower your risk of the cancer coming back, or of getting a new skin cancer.At this time, not enough is known about melanoma to say for sure if there are things you can do that will be helpful. We do know that people who have had melanoma are at higher risk for developing another melanoma or other type of skin cancer. Because of this, it’s very important to limit your exposure to UV rays (from the sun or tanning beds) and to continue to examine your skin every month for signs of melanoma coming back or possible new skin cancers. Skin cancers that are found early are typically much easier to treat than those found at a later stage.Adopting healthy behaviors such as not smoking, eating well, being active, and staying at a healthy weight might help as well, but no one knows for sure. However, we do know that these types of changes can have positive effects on your health that can extend beyond your risk of melanoma or other cancers.About dietary supplementsSo far, no dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, and herbal products) have been shown to clearly help lower the risk of melanoma progressing or coming back. This doesn’t mean that no supplements will help, but it’s important to know that none have been proven to do so.Dietary supplements are not regulated like medicines in the United States – they do not have to be proven effective (or even safe) before being sold, although there are limits on what they’re allowed to claim they can do. If you are thinking about taking any type of nutritional supplement, talk to your health care team. They can help you decide which ones you can use safely while avoiding those that might be harmful.If the cancer comes backIf melanoma does come back at some point, your treatment options will depend on where the cancer is, what treatments you’ve had before, and your overall health. For more on how recurrent cancer is treated, see Treatment of Melanoma Skin Cancer by Stage. For more general information on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence.Could I get a second cancer after melanoma treatment?People who’ve had melanoma can still get other cancers. In fact, melanoma survivors are at higher risk for getting some other types of cancer:Another skin cancer, including melanoma (this is different from the first cancer coming back)Salivary gland cancerSmall intestine cancerBreast cancer (in women)Prostate cancerKidney cancerThyroid cancerSoft tissue cancerNon-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)The most common second cancer in survivors of skin melanoma is another skin cancer.There are steps you can take to lower your risk of getting another cancer and stay as healthy as possible. For example, it’s important to limit your exposure to UV rays, which can increase your risk for many types of skin cancer. It’s also important to stay away from tobacco products. Smoking increases the risk of many cancers.To help maintain good health, melanoma survivors should also:Get to and stay at a healthy weightKeep physically active and limit the time you spend sitting or lying downFollow a healthy eating pattern that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limits or avoids red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and highly processed foodsNot drink alcohol. If you do drink, have no more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 per day for menThese steps may also lower the risk of other health problems.Melanoma survivors should also follow the American Cancer Society guidelines for the early detection of cancer, such as those for colorectal and lung cancer. Most experts don’t recommend any other specific tests to look for second cancers unless you have symptoms.Getting emotional supportSome amount of feeling depressed, anxious, or worried is normal when melanoma is a part of your life. Some people are affected more than others. But everyone can benefit from help and support from other people, whether friends and family, religious groups, support groups, professional counselors, or others. Learn more in Life After Cancer.",

Some people have a higher risk of getting melanoma than others, but it’s important to know that anyone can get melanoma.Skin self-examAlthough the American Cancer Society does not have guidelines for the early detection of skin cancer, knowing your own skin is important to finding skin cancer early. You should know the pattern of moles, blemishes, freckles, and other marks on your skin so that you’ll notice any new moles or changes in existing moles.Many doctors recommend checking your own skin, preferably once a month. Skin self-exams are best done in a well-lit room in front of a full-length mirror. Use a hand-held mirror to help look at areas that are hard to see, such as the backs of your thighs. Examine all areas, including your palms and soles, scalp, ears, nails, and your back (in men, the back is a common place for melanomas to start). Friends and family members can also help you with these exams, especially for those hard-to-see areas, such as your scalp and back.To learn more, see How to Do a Skin Self Exam.See Signs and Symptoms of Melanoma Skin Cancer to learn about what to look for when examining your skin. Any spots on the skin that are new or changing in size, shape, or color should be seen by a doctor promptly. Be sure to show your doctor any areas that concern you, and ask your doctor to look at areas that may be hard for you to see.Exam by a health care professionalSome doctors and other health care professionals do skin exams as part of routine health check-ups.If your primary doctor finds any unusual moles or other suspicious areas, they may refer you to a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in skin problems. Dermatologists can also do regular skin exams. Many dermatologists use a technique called dermoscopy (also known as dermatoscopy, epiluminescence microscopy [ELM], or surface microscopy) to look at spots on the skin more clearly. A photo of the spot may be taken as well. (See Tests for Melanoma Skin Cancer for more information.)Regular skin exams are especially important for people who are at higher risk of melanoma, such as people with dysplastic nevus syndrome, people with a strong family history of melanoma, and people who have had melanoma before. If you have many moles, your doctor might advise taking full-body photos so your moles can be tracked over time and new ones can be seen more readily.

It can be either flat or raised. It can be round or oval. Moles are generally less than 6 millimeters (about ¼ inch) across (about the width of a pencil eraser). Some moles can be present at birth, but most appear during childhood or young adulthood. New moles that appear later in life should be checked by a doctor.Once a mole has developed, it will usually stay the same size, shape, and color for many years. Some moles may eventually fade away.Most people have moles, and almost all moles are harmless. But it’s important to recognize changes in a mole – such as in its size, shape, color, or texture – that can suggest a melanoma may be developing.Possible signs and symptoms of melanomaThe most important warning sign of melanoma is a new spot on the skin or a spot that is changing in size, shape, or color.Another important sign is a spot that looks different from all of the other spots on your skin (known as the ugly duckling sign).If you have one of these warning signs, have your skin checked by a doctor.The ABCDE rule is another guide to the usual signs of melanoma. Be on the lookout and tell your doctor about spots that have any of the following features:A is for Asymmetry: One half of a mole or birthmark does not match the other.B is for Border: The edges are irregular, ragged, notched, or blurred.C is for Color: The color is not the same all over and may include different shades of brown or black, or sometimes with patches of pink, red, white, or blue.D is for Diameter: The spot is larger than 6 millimeters across (about ¼ inch – the size of a pencil eraser), although melanomas can sometimes be smaller than this.E is for Evolving: The mole is changing in size, shape, or color.Some melanomas don’t fit these rules. It’s important to tell your doctor about any changes or new spots on the skin, or growths that look different from the rest of your moles.Other warning signs are:A sore that doesn’t healSpread of pigment from the border of a spot into surrounding skinRedness or a new swelling beyond the border of the moleChange in sensation, such as itchiness, tenderness, or painChange in the surface of a mole – scaliness, oozing, bleeding, or the appearance of a lump or bumpBe sure to show your doctor any areas that concern you and ask your doctor to look at areas that may be hard for you to see. It’s sometimes hard to tell the difference between melanoma and an ordinary mole, even for doctors, so it’s important to show your doctor any mole that you are unsure of.To see examples of normal moles and melanomas, visit the Skin Cancer Image Gallery on our website.Remember, too, that a small portion of melanomas start in places other than the skin, such as under a fingernail or toenail, inside the mouth, or even in the colored part of the eye (iris), so it’s important to show a doctor any new or changing spots in these areas as well.",

New moles that appear later in life should be checked by a doctor.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">Once a mole has developed, it will usually stay the same size, shape, and color for many years. Some moles may eventually fade away.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">Most people have moles, and almost all moles are harmless. But it’s important to recognize changes in a mole – such as in its size, shape, color, or texture – that can suggest a melanoma may be developing.</p> <h2 class=\"subtitle\"><b>Possible signs and symptoms of melanoma</b></h2> <p class=\"section_content\">The most important warning sign of melanoma is <b>a new spot on the skin or a spot that is changing in size, shape, or color</b>.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">Another important sign is <b>a spot that looks different from all of the other spots on your skin</b> (known as the <i>ugly duckling sign</i>).</p> <p class=\"section_content\">If you have one of these warning signs, have your skin checked by a doctor.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">The <b>ABCDE</b> rule is another guide to the usual signs of melanoma. Be on the lookout and tell your doctor about spots that have any of the following features:</p> <ul> <li><b>A is for Asymmetry:</b> One half of a mole or birthmark does not match the other.</li> <li><b>B is for Border:</b><i> </i>The edges are irregular, ragged, notched, or blurred.</li> <li><b>C is for Color:</b><i> </i>The color is not the same all over and may include different shades of brown or black, or sometimes with patches of pink, red, white, or blue.</li> <li><b>D is for Diameter:</b><i> </i>The spot is larger than 6 millimeters across (about ¼ inch – the size of a pencil eraser), although melanomas can sometimes be smaller than this.</li> <li><b>E is for Evolving:</b> The mole is changing in size, shape, or color.</li> </ul> <p class=\"section_content\">Some melanomas don’t fit these rules. It’s important to tell your doctor about any changes or new spots on the skin, or growths that look different from the rest of your moles.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">Other warning signs are:</p> <ul> <li>A sore that doesn’t heal</li> <li>Spread of pigment from the border of a spot into surrounding skin</li> <li>Redness or a new swelling beyond the border of the mole</li> <li>Change in sensation, such as itchiness, tenderness, or pain</li> <li>Change in the surface of a mole – scaliness, oozing, bleeding, or the appearance of a lump or bump</li> </ul> <p class=\"section_content\">Be sure to show your doctor any areas that concern you and ask your doctor to look at areas that may be hard for you to see. It’s sometimes hard to tell the difference between melanoma and an ordinary mole, even for doctors, so it’s important to show your doctor any mole that you are unsure of.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">To see examples of normal moles and melanomas, visit the Skin Cancer Image Gallery on our website.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">Remember, too, that a small portion of melanomas start in places other than the skin, such as under a fingernail or toenail, inside the mouth, or even in the colored part of the eye (iris), so it’s important to show a doctor any new or changing spots in these areas as well.</p>"

            "content": "After someone is diagnosed with melanoma, doctors will try to figure out if it has spread, and if so, how far. This process is called staging. The stage of a cancer describes how much cancer is in the body. It helps determine how serious the cancer is and how best to treat it. Doctors also use a cancer's stage when talking about survival statistics.The earliest stage melanomas are stage 0 (melanoma in situ), and then range from stages I (1) through IV (4). Some stages are split further, using capital letters (A, B, etc.). As a rule, the lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means cancer has spread more. And within a stage, an earlier letter means a lower stage. Although each person’s cancer experience is unique, cancers with similar stages tend to have a similar outlook and are often treated in much the same way.How is the stage determined?The staging system most often used for melanoma is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system, which is based on 3 key pieces of information:The extent of the main (primary) tumor (T): How deep has the cancer grown into the skin? Is the cancer ulcerated?Tumor thickness: The thickness of the melanoma is called the Breslow measurement. In general, melanomas less than 1 millimeter (mm) thick (about 1/25 of an inch) have a very small chance of spreading. As the melanoma becomes thicker, it has a greater chance of spreading.Ulceration: Ulceration is a breakdown of the skin over the melanoma. Melanomas that are ulcerated tend to have a worse outlook.The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N): Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes?The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): Has the cancer spread to distant lymph nodes or distant organs ? (Melanoma can spread almost anywhere in the body, but the most common sites of spread are the lungs, liver, brain, bones, and the skin or lymph nodes in other parts of the body.)Numbers or letters after T, N, and M provide more details about each of these factors. Higher numbers mean the cancer is more advanced. Once a person’s T, N, and M categories have been determined, this information is combined in a process called stage grouping to assign an overall stage. For more information, see Cancer Staging.The staging system in the table below uses the pathologic stage (also called the surgical stage). This is determined by examining tissue removed during an operation. Sometimes, if surgery is not possible right away (or at all), the cancer will be given a clinical stage instead. This is based on the results of physical exams, biopsies, and imaging tests (as described in Tests for Melanoma Skin Cancer). The clinical stage will be used to help plan treatment. Sometimes, though, the cancer has spread farther than the clinical stage estimates, so it may not predict a person’s outlook as accurately as a pathologic stage. If your cancer has been clinically staged, it is best to talk to your doctor about your specific stage.The table below is a simplified version of the most recent TNM system, effective as of 2018.Melanoma staging can be very complex, so if you have any questions about the stage of your cancer or what it means, ask your doctor to explain it to you in a way you understand.AJCC StageMelanoma Stage Description0The cancer is confined to the epidermis, the outermost skin layer (Tis).

They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding of how likely it is that your treatment will be successful.Keep in mind that survival rates are estimates and are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of people who had a specific cancer, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. These statistics can be confusing and may lead you to have more questions. Your doctor knows your situation, so ask them how these numbers might apply to you.What is a 5-year relative survival rate?A relative survival rate compares people with the same type and stage of cancer to people in the overall population. For example, if the 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of melanoma of the skin is 90%, it means that people who have that cancer are, on average, about 90% as likely as people who don’t have that cancer to live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed.Where do these numbers come from?The American Cancer Society relies on information from the SEER* database, maintained by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), to provide survival statistics for different types of cancer.The SEER database tracks 5-year relative survival rates for melanoma skin cancer in the United States, based on how far the cancer has spread. The SEER database, however, does not group cancers by AJCC TNM stages (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, etc.). Instead, it groups cancers into localized, regional, and distant stages:Localized: There is no sign that the cancer has spread beyond the skin where it started.Regional: The cancer has spread beyond the skin where it started to nearby structures or lymph nodes.Distant: The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, or skin on other parts of the body.5-year relative survival rates for melanoma skin cancerThese numbers are based on people diagnosed with melanoma between 2011 and 2017SEER stage5-year relative survival rateLocalized99%Regional68%Distant30%All SEER stages combined93%Understanding the numbersThese numbers apply only to the stage of the cancer when it is first diagnosed. They do not apply later on if the cancer grows, spreads, or comes back after treatment.These numbers don’t take everything into account. Survival rates are grouped based on how far the cancer has spread, but your age, overall health, how well the cancer responds to treatment, and other factors can also affect your outlook. For example, younger people tend to have a better outlook than older people, regardless of the stage. And people who have weakened immune systems, such as those who have had organ transplants or who are infected with HIV, are at greater risk of dying from their melanoma.People now being diagnosed with melanoma may have a better outlook than these numbers show. Treatments have improved over time, and these numbers are based on people who were diagnosed and treated at least five years earlier.*SEER = Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results",

            "content": "What is melanoma?Cancer can start any place in the body. Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts when skin cells called melanocytes grow out of control.Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body and grow there. When cancer cells do this, it’s called metastasis. To doctors, the cancer cells in the new place look just like the ones that started in the skin.Cancer is always named based on the place where it starts. So when melanoma skin cancer spreads to any other organ, it’s still called melanoma.illustration showing cross section of the skin including location of hair follicle, epidermis, dermis and subcutis with details of the epidermis showing squamous cells, melanocyte and basal cellsThe skinAsk your doctor to use this picture to show you where your cancer isWhat is a melanocyte?Melanocytes are cells in the skin. They make a brown pigment called melanin, which makes the skin brown or tan.Are there different kinds of skin cancer?There are many types of skin cancer. Your doctor can tell you more about the type of skin cancer you have.Basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are much more common than melanoma and don’t often spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is more deadly because it is more likely to spread to other parts of the body.Questions to ask the doctorWhy do you think I have cancer?Is there a chance I don’t have cancer?Would you please write down the kind of cancer you think I might have?What will happen next?How does the doctor know I have melanoma?A new spot on your skin or a spot that’s changing in size, shape, or color may be a warning sign of melanoma. If you have any of these changes, have your skin checked by a doctor.The doctor will ask you questions about when the spot on your skin first showed up and if it has changed in size or the way it looks. The rest of your skin will be checked. During the exam your doctor will check the size, shape, color and texture of any skin changes. If signs are pointing to melanoma, more tests will be done.Tests that might be doneBiopsy: In a biopsy, the doctor takes out a small piece of tissue to check it for cancer cells. A biopsy is the only way to tell for sure if you have skin cancer and what kind it is. There are many types of skin biopsies. Ask your doctor what kind you will need. Each type has pros and cons. The choice of which type to use depends on your own case.Lab tests of biopsy samples: If melanoma is found, lab tests might be done on the cancer cells to see if they have certain gene changes. This might affect your treatment options.Chest x-ray: This test may be done to see if the melanoma has spread to your lungs.Ultrasound: This test uses sound waves and their echoes to make pictures of the inside of your body. Ultrasound might be used to look at lymph nodes (small collections of immune cells) near the tumor to see if the cancer has spread there.CT or CAT scan: This test uses x-rays to make detailed pictures of your insides. A CT scan may be used to see if nearby lymph nodes are swollen or if organs like the lungs or liver have spots that might be from the spread of melanoma. If any spots are found, a CT scan might be used to guide a needle into the spots to do a biopsy.MRI scan: This test uses radio waves and strong magnets instead of x-rays to make detailed pictures of your insides. It's very good for looking at the brain and spinal cord. This test can help show if the cancer has spread.PET scan: PET scans use a special kind of sugar that can be seen inside your body with a special camera. If there’s cancer, this sugar shows up as “hot spots” where the cancer is found. This test can help show if and where the cancer has spread.Questions to ask the doctorWhat tests will I need?Who will do these tests?Where will they be done?Who can explain them to me?How and when will I get the results?Who will explain the results to me?What do I need to do next?How serious is my cancer?If you have melanoma, the doctor will want to find out how far it has spread. This is called staging. Your doctor will want to find out the stage of your cancer to help decide what type of treatment is best for you.The stage describes the growth or spread of the melanoma through the skin. It also tells if it has spread to other parts of your body.Your cancer can be stage 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, like stage 4, means a more serious cancer that has spread beyond the skin. Be sure to ask the doctor about the cancer stage and what it means for you.Questions to ask the doctorDo you know the stage of the cancer?If not, how and when will you find out the stage of the cancer?Would you explain to me what the stage means in my case?Based on the stage of melanoma, how long do you think I’ll live?What will happen next?What kind of treatment will I need?There are many ways to treat melanoma. The main types of treatment are:SurgeryImmunotherapyTargeted therapyChemotherapyRadiationMost early stage melanomas can be treated with surgery alone. More advanced cancers need other treatments.The treatment plan that’s best for you will depend on:The stage of the cancerThe results of lab tests on the cancer cellsThe chance that a type of treatment will cure the melanoma or help in some wayYour ageOther health problems you haveYour feelings about the treatment and the side effects that come with itSurgerySurgery is the main treatment for most melanomas. It can often cure early-stage melanomas. There are different kinds of surgery. The type that’s best for you depends on how large the melanoma is and where it is. Ask your doctor what kind of surgery you will have and what to expect.Side effects of surgeryAny type of surgery can have risks and side effects. Be sure to ask the doctor what you can expect. If you have problems, let your doctors know. Doctors who treat people with melanoma should be able to help you with any problems that come up.ImmunotherapyImmunotherapy is treatment that boosts your own immune system to attack the melanoma cells. Many types of immunotherapy are used to treat melanoma. These drugs may be given into a vein, given as a shot, or taken as pills.Side effects of immunotherapyImmunotherapy can cause many different side effects, depending on which drug is used. Some of these drugs might make you feel tired, sick to your stomach, and cause fever, chills, and rashes. Most of these problems go away after treatment ends.There are ways to treat most of the side effects from immunotherapy. If you have side effects, talk to your cancer care team so they can help.Targeted therapyTargeted therapy drugs may be used for certain types of melanoma. These drugs affect mainly cancer cells and not normal cells in the body. They may work even if other treatment doesn’t. They may cause fewer side effects.ChemoChemo is the short word for chemotherapy – the use of drugs to fight cancer. The drugs may be given into a vein or taken as pills. These drugs go into the blood and spread through the body. They kill cells that are fast growing cancer cells and good cells like blood cells and hair. Chemo is given in cycles or rounds. Each round of treatment is followed by a break. Most of the time, 2 or more chemo drugs are given. Treatment often lasts for many months.Side effects of chemoChemo can make you feel very tired, sick to your stomach, and cause your hair to fall out. But these problems go away after treatment ends.There are ways to treat most chemo side effects. If you have side effects, talk to your cancer care team so they can help.Radiation treatmentsRadiation uses high-energy rays (like x-rays) to kill cancer cells. Radiation is not usually used to treat the main spot on the skin. But it may be used after surgery to help keep the melanoma from coming back.Side effects of radiation treatmentsIf your doctor suggests radiation treatment, talk about what side effects might happen. Side effects depend on the part of the body that’s treated. The most common side effects of radiation are:Sunburn-like skin changes where the radiation is givenHair loss where the radiation enters the bodyFeeling very tired (fatigue)Most side effects get better after treatment ends. Some might last longer. Talk to your cancer care team about what you can expect.Clinical trialsClinical trials are research studies that test new drugs or other treatments in people. They compare standard treatments with others that may be better.Clinical trials are one way to get the newest cancer treatment. They are the best way for doctors to find better ways to treat cancer. If your doctor can find one that’s studying the kind of cancer you have, it’s up to you whether to take part. And if you do sign up for a clinical trial, you can always stop at any time.If you would like to learn more about clinical trials that might be right for you, start by asking your doctor if your clinic or hospital conducts clinical trials. See Clinical Trials to learn more.What about other treatments I hear about?When you have cancer you might hear about other ways to treat the cancer or treat your symptoms. These may not always be standard medical treatments. These treatments may be vitamins, herbs, special diets, and other things. You may wonder about these treatments.Some of these are known to help, but many have not been tested. Some have been shown not to help. A few have even been found to be harmful. Talk to your doctor about anything you’re thinking about using, whether it’s a vitamin, a diet, or anything else.Questions to ask the doctorHow far has the melanoma spread under my skin?Has it spread anywhere else?What treatment do you think is best for me?What’s the goal of this treatment? Do you think it could cure the cancer?Will treatment include surgery? If so, who will do the surgery?What will the surgery be like?Will I need other types of treatment, too?What’s the goal of these treatments?What side effects could I have from these treatments?What can I do about side effects that I might have?Is there a clinical trial that might be right for me?What about special vitamins or diets that friends tell me about? How will I know if they are safe?How soon do I need to start treatment?What should I do to be ready for treatment?Is there anything I can do to help the treatment work better?What’s the next step?What will happen after treatment?You’ll be glad when treatment is over. For years after treatment, you will see your cancer doctor. Be sure to go to all of these follow-up visits. You will have exams, blood tests, and maybe other tests to see if the cancer has come back.At first, your visits may be every few months. Then, the longer you’re cancer-free, the less often the visits are needed. After 5 years, they may be done once a year.Having cancer and dealing with treatment can be hard, but it can also be a time to look at your life in new ways. You might be thinking about how to improve your health. Call us at 1-800-227-2345 or talk to your cancer care team to find out what you can do to feel better.You can’t change the fact that you have cancer. What you can change is how you live the rest of your life – making healthy choices and feeling as good as you can.",

            "content": "OverviewMelanomaMelanomaOpen pop-up dialog boxMelanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin - the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can also form in your eyes and, rarely, inside your body, such as in your nose or throat.The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds increases your risk of developing melanoma. Limiting your exposure to UV radiation can help reduce your risk of melanoma.The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. Knowing the warning signs of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is detected early.SymptomsMolesMolesOpen pop-up dialog boxMelanomaMelanomaOpen pop-up dialog boxMelanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face.Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin.The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:A change in an existing moleThe development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skinMelanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin.Normal molesNormal moles are generally a uniform color - such as tan, brown or black - with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter - the size of a pencil eraser.Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age.Unusual moles that may indicate melanomaTo help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE:A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves.B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders - characteristics of melanomas.C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color.D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding.Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.Hidden melanomasMelanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area.Hidden melanomas include:Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment.Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions.Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea - the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera). An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.When to see a doctorMake an appointment with your doctor if you notice any skin changes that seem unusual.",
            "html_content": "<h2 class=\"subtitle\">Overview</h2> <p class=\"section_content\">Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin — the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can also form in your eyes and, rarely, inside your body, such as in your nose or throat.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds increases your risk of developing melanoma. Limiting your exposure to UV radiation can help reduce your risk of melanoma.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. Knowing the warning signs of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is detected early.</p> <p style=\"margin-left:23.35px;\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:205.45px;\" src=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/43/ds00190_-ds00439_im04411_mcdc7_melanomathu_jpg.jpg\" alt=\"Melanoma \"></p> <p class=\"img_description\"><b>Melanoma</b></p> <h2 class=\"subtitle\">Symptoms</h2> <p class=\"section_content\">Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:</p> <ul> <li>A change in an existing mole</li> <li>The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin</li> </ul> <p class=\"section_content\">Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin.</p> <h3 class=\"subheading\"><b>Normal moles</b></h3> <p class=\"section_content\">Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser.</p> <p class=\"section_content\">Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age.</p> <h3 class=\"subheading\"><b>Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma</b></h3> <p class=\"section_content\">To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE:</p> <ul> <li><b>A is for asymmetrical shape.</b> Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves.</li> <li><b>B is for irregular border.</b> Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas.</li> <li><b>C is for changes in color.</b> Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color.</li> <li><b>D is for diameter.</b> Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).</li> <li><b>E is for evolving.</b> Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape.

Your doctor will ask questions about your health history and examine your skin to look for signs that may indicate melanoma.Removing a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). To determine whether a suspicious skin lesion is melanoma, your doctor may recommend removing a sample of skin for testing. The sample is sent to a lab for examination.What type of biopsy procedure your doctor recommends will depend on your particular situation. Most often doctors recommend removing the entire growth when possible. One common technique, the punch biopsy, is done with a circular blade that's pressed into the skin around the suspicious mole. Another technique, called an excisional biopsy, uses a scalpel to cut away the entire mole and a small margin of healthy tissue around it.Determining the extent of the melanomaRelated informationMelanoma spread: How lymph nodes play a role in detectionIf you receive a diagnosis of melanoma, the next step is to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer. To assign a stage to your melanoma, your doctor will:Determine the thickness. The thickness of a melanoma is determined by carefully examining the melanoma under a microscope and measuring it with a special tool. The thickness of a melanoma helps doctors decide on a treatment plan. In general, the thicker the tumor, the more serious the disease.Thinner melanomas may only require surgery to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it. If the melanoma is thicker, your doctor may recommend additional tests to see if the cancer has spread before determining your treatment options.See if the melanoma has spread to the lymph nodes. If there's a risk that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, your doctor may recommend a procedure known as a sentinel node biopsy.During a sentinel node biopsy, a dye is injected in the area where your melanoma was removed. The dye flows to the nearby lymph nodes. The first lymph nodes to take up the dye are removed and tested for cancer cells. If these first lymph nodes (sentinel lymph nodes) are cancer-free, there's a good chance that the melanoma has not spread beyond the area where it was first discovered.Look for signs of cancer beyond the skin. For people with more-advanced melanomas, doctors may recommend imaging tests to look for signs that the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. Imaging tests may include X-rays, CT scans and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. These imaging tests generally aren't recommended for smaller melanomas with a lower risk of spreading beyond the skin.Other factors may go into determining the risk that the cancer may spread (metastasize), including whether the skin over the area has formed an open sore (ulceration) and how many dividing cancer cells (mitoses) are found when looking under a microscope.Melanoma is staged using the Roman numerals 0 through IV. At stage 0 and stage I, a melanoma is small and has a very successful treatment rate. But the higher the numeral, the lower the chances of a full recovery. By stage IV, the cancer has spread beyond your skin to other organs, such as your lungs or liver.TreatmentThe best treatment for your melanoma depends on the size and stage of cancer, your overall health, and your personal preferences.Treatment for small melanomasTreatment for early-stage melanomas usually includes surgery to remove the melanoma. A very thin melanoma may be removed entirely during the biopsy and require no further treatment. Otherwise, your surgeon will remove the cancer as well as a border of normal skin and a layer of tissue beneath the skin. For people with early-stage melanomas, this may be the only treatment needed.Treating melanomas that have spread beyond the skinIf melanoma has spread beyond the skin, treatment options may include:Surgery to remove affected lymph nodes. If melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes, your surgeon may remove the affected nodes. Additional treatments before or after surgery also may be recommended.Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a drug treatment that helps your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system might not attack cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.Immunotherapy is often recommended after surgery for melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes or to other areas of the body. When melanoma can't be removed completely with surgery, immunotherapy treatments might be injected directly into the melanoma.Targeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific weaknesses present within cancer cells. By targeting these weaknesses, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Cells from your melanoma may be tested to see if targeted therapy is likely to be effective against your cancer.For melanoma, targeted therapy might be recommended if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes or to other areas of your body.Radiation therapy. This treatment uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be directed to the lymph nodes if the melanoma has spread there. Radiation therapy can also be used to treat melanomas that can't be removed completely with surgery.For melanoma that spreads to other areas of the body, radiation therapy can help relieve symptoms.Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be given intravenously, in pill form or both so that it travels throughout your body.Chemotherapy can also be given in a vein in your arm or leg in a procedure called isolated limb perfusion. During this procedure, blood in your arm or leg isn't allowed to travel to other areas of your body for a short time so that the chemotherapy drugs travel directly to the area around the melanoma and don't affect other parts of your body.Coping and supportA cancer diagnosis can change your life forever. Each person finds his or her own way of coping with the emotional and physical changes cancer brings. But when you're first diagnosed with cancer, sometimes it's difficult to know what to do next.Here are some ideas to help you cope:Learn enough about melanoma to make decisions about your care. Ask your doctor about your cancer, including your treatment options and, if you like, your prognosis. As you learn more about cancer, you may become more confident in making treatment decisions.Keep friends and family close. Keeping your close relationships strong will help you deal with your cancer. Friends and family can provide the practical support you'll need, such as helping take care of your home if you're in the hospital. And they can serve as emotional support when you feel overwhelmed by cancer.Find someone to talk with. Find a good listener who is willing to listen to you talk about your hopes and fears. This may be a friend or family member. The concern and understanding of a counselor, medical social worker, clergy member or cancer support group also may be helpful.Ask your doctor about support groups in your area. Other sources of information include the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society.Preparing for your appointmentStart by seeing your family doctor if you notice any skin changes that concern you. Depending on your situation and the outcome of any tests, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in skin diseases (dermatologist) or to a doctor who specializes in cancer treatment (oncologist).Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot to discuss, it's a good idea to be well prepared for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready and know what to expect from your doctor.What you can doBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet.Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.Make a list of all medications, vitamins or supplements you're taking.Take a family member or friend along. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.Write down questions to ask your doctor.Your time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important, in case time runs out. For melanoma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:Do I have melanoma?How large is my melanoma?How deep is my melanoma?Has my melanoma spread beyond the area of skin where it was first discovered?What additional tests do I need?What are my treatment options?Can any treatment cure my melanoma?What are the potential side effects of each treatment option?Is there one treatment you feel is best for me?How long can I take to decide on a treatment option?Should I see a specialist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover it?Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?What will determine whether I should plan for a follow-up visit?In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.",
